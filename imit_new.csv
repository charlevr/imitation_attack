On my way back I got hit by a truck driver from behind who was apparently sleeping while driving. Due to this unfortunate incident your car got seriously damaged and I sustained a major injury on my forehead. I am very sorry I had to wreck your car because I know how valuable and expensive the car cost. I am actually at the hospital presently waiting to be discharged by the doctor after a major surgery was conducted on my forehead. I am waiting for my mom or my dad to  come clear the bills and take me home after I have been discharged. I intend to go fix your car at any automobile shop with good reputation after I leave the hospital. Thank you for your understanding and I hope to see you soon.",0,4,email
1,"Hi mom! I am sorry I haven't been able to reach out for a while, it was due to the fact that I was hospitalized for several days. I was involved in an accident which a;almost took my life four days back. The accident occurred on my way back from school, I was walking home on the pedestrian lane when suddenly a driver lost control of his vehicle due to break failure and then ran me over from behind. The accident occurred just few blocks from the school gate. I immediately lost consciousness because of the impact of the accident and also shock. I woke up after about 16 hours in the hospital where I was receiving treatment. I only got discharged yesterday and I am currently at home now though still on medications for some weeks.",0,0,email

3,Hello mummy! Please i will be needing the password to the school website account you created om my behalf. I need to access the account and get some vital information as regards my education but I can't login because I don't have the password to the account.

After I am done with the account this once you can decide to change the account password to any other just to lock me out of the account.

I am currently in the hospital receiving treatment after I suffered from food poisoning this morning. I was actually on my way to the office when suddenly my stomach began to ache me and then I was pressed. I rushed back home to use the convenience when I noticed I was stooling. Then few minutes later I started vomiting,so I had to rush to the hospital to get myself treated. After running some tests, the doctor told me I was suffering from food poisoning which was caused by a rear strain of bacterium and so advised I remain in the hospital for some hours to receive treatment. Thank you.",0,8,email
5,Good day everyone. I hope you all are good and great. First I really want to apologize for my sloppiness and being extremely late for this very important meeting but I completely take responsibility for this not that I am blaming anything or anyone but myself. Things got out of hand and so there was no possible way for me to handle it than the way I did. I am deeply sorry and truly beg your pardon to explain myself and with a heart of consideration you look into my explanation be merciful on me. Truly from the depth of my heart I am sorry for the set back from my end. Here was how it went. When I woke up having set my alarm and everything was in place my son all of a sudden a serious headache which I didnt want to self medicate and wait for later but rather take him straight to the hospital due to my family medical history. There have been cases of headaches which later led to death and this made it paramount that I took my child to go see a doctor. I hope you consider my above explanation and I promised never to be a set back in such a way again.,1,4,email
6,First I will not be thinking of selling it online but rather offline and a hand to hand business deal. I will be quite patient and see through for someone who is desperate for a phone and market the phone as their alternative even with it unsatisfactory state to some extent and try and convince them with sweet talks but not sounding too desperate to cut the deal so I can gain some ground. Having done that if it taking too long I will result to a online deal and try go to a second hand website for used device and with that I believe everyone knows that a used device have a tendency of having issue in the long run of a sort. With the above I believe this should do and also I will make to pray for a deal to come my way.,1,9,email

I even tried to change it myself, but that was just hopeless since I'm not strong enough to get the screw-things off. I called AAA, but they're saying it could take up to an hour!! Everyone I know is already at word, so I don't know what else to do. I have to just wait for them. Is there a way to listen in on the meeting on my phone, as I wait? I really wanted to be there. I don't know if I ran over something, or there's something wrong with my tire. Please know that I would be there if I could, and I will come in as soon as this is fixed.

11,"I have a late-model phone. It has been working for me very well. I got it shortly after the latest model was released and haven't had any problems with it. Just recently, it was dropped and there is a small crack in the screen. It has not affected the functionality of the phone, but I had an estimate to get the screen replaced. The cost is low but, since my contract allows for a new phone this year, I do not wish to spend the extra money on this one. For that reason, I will sell this phone for a bit below its value, allowing for replacement of the cracked screen if you so wish. This phone's speed is quite good and it takes high-quality photos. If the screen crack does not bother you, you can get this phone at a great price!",2,1,email
12,"Hi, first, I want to thank you for letting me borrow your car. It's a dream to drive and I got a lot of attention when I took it out the other night. I went to the club down the street here, and drove around the block several times before I found a spot big enough to park the car - and leave space front and back - but not enough space to fit other cars! I double-checked my parking and went into the club for a few hours. When I came out, I found the car still in the spot, but with the side smashed in. It looks like someone hit it broadside. I could not open the door on the driver's side, and could not get it started when I got inside. I had it towed and I am waiting for an estimate. My insurance company is sending an inspector this morning. I will handle the deductible and any related expenses. I am so sorry about this, and promise to get it taken care of as soon as possible.",2,9,email

14,"Good morning everyone. As you know, this quarter has been a tough one, and the upcoming quarter will obviously be worse. For that reason, more time is required for a plan to be devised. We all need to go into this next meeting with concrete ideas of how we are going to approach the challenges of the next quarter. I am therefore pushing back the current meeting, and asking that everyone come next week instead. Use this time to fine-tune any ideas you expected to present. I expect that everyone was already prepared, but things are changing quickly, and our plans much change with them. The new date will be a week from Friday and I hope to hear detailed progress reports and ideas on how to more forward in these trying times. Thank you.",2,2,email
15,"The key word is ""periodically"" which most insurers define as less than 12 times a year. If your roommate, neighbor or friend is driving your car on a regular basis, that person should be added to your policy, which will most likely increase your premium.

There are ""named driver policies"" out there although they are fairly rare. This type of policy only covers drivers who are explicitly named on the policy. That means accidents are covered if  you let someone drive your car who is not named on your policy.

It is also possible for an insurer to lower coverage levels when an occasional driver is behind the wheel. Insurance companies in eight states are legally allowed to reduce coverage limits for any driver that is not specifically listed on your policy",3,3,email

20,"Hey Everyone, I just wanted you all to know why I am so late. This is going to be hard to believe but I swear every word is the truth. Well you know we had that big storm last night right? About 3 am I heard a loud boom. I got up to find that a tree from my backyard had fallen on my car. It missed the house by inches. When the tree fell it hit the power line and we lost electricity. After being up the rest of the night I fell asleep around daylight and just woke up. That is why I am so late. But now I have to figure out what to do about the car and we still don't have any power. I am hoping that we can reschedule this meeting. I understand how important it is. It's just with everything that is going on I can't leave home unless of course you all want to chip in and get me a new car. Just joking.",4,4,email
21,Hey I heard that you were trying to find used electronics for the kids to use. I have a tablet that would be great for them. I am willing to let it go for less than I was originally trying to get because I know how much you want them for the kids. Getting a used one would be a great way for them to practice for a more expensive one in the future. The one that I have is perfect for kids and it's a steal! Let me know as soon as possible if you would be interested. At this sale price it might not last long. But if you are interested I can hold it for you until payday if necessary. I really do want your kids to be the ones who get this. So if you would like to make a deal just let me know as soon as you can.,4,9,email

The morning started out like normal. I stopped for my usual coffee run and then continued on in. I came to a construction zone and followed the workers directions when all of a sudden there was a horrible noise, coffee was everywhere and my car is sitting in the biggest pothole that you have ever seen. I had to wait for a tow truck to get it out. So now it's at the shop. I had to get a cab and stop at the clothes store for something to wear. As you can see my morning has not been what I hoped for.

You know how much I have been wanting to see them in concert. If you don't want to use your credit card you could just send cash and I will go to the box office and get the tickets. I need to know as soon as possible or they will be sold out. If you prefer to send a check that is okay too. If you want me to get you a ticket to go just let me know.,4,6,email

So get back with me as quick as you can so that I can take care of this for you. I don't mind in the least to do it for you. I am glad to help you always in any way that I can.

I most sincerely apologize for my tardiness to the meeting. Unfortunately, a drunk driver had crashed their car into my house, and I had to talk to authorities to get that settled.

Given my track record, this is the only time I have been late and was due to something outside of my control. I guarantee that this is the first and last time i will be late to a meeting and I will do everything in my power to help this company succeed.

I have an important dance competition happening in Las Vegas in about two months and the dance team I am on needs to book the flights, hotel, and pay for the competition. I don't have enough money in my checking account to pay for all this, which will probably cost around 500 dollars. Most of my money, as you know, is in my savings account, so I just wanted to pull a small chunk of money to help pay for this. Don't worry, mom, I won't recklessly spend because you know I am very stingy. But you know that this dance competition is very important to me, especially since it's the worldwide dance competition taking place in Las Vegas. I only compete at these kinds of events once a year, so I would be so happy if I could use your password to access my savings account.",5,7,email

Furthermore, the prize pool for this tournament is in the millions. If you do agree to this, I would need it by next month and you can just do a wire transfer to my bank account. Again, I humbly ask for you help Uncle George. It would mean a lot to me because this is such an important tournament.",5,8,email

There is one small thing though, and I am so sorry to not have told you this earlier, but currently the screen of the tablet actually a bit worn out. I know it sounds bad, but it actually wasn't cracked from being careless dropped. What had happened was that my son, who will be unable to attend his martial arts lessons in the future if I am not able to raise funds in time, had gotten a hold of the tablet and charged it with the incorrect voltage charger. This had thus actually lit the tablet on fire, but luckily we had gotten to it immediately to reduce damages. In fact, you can barely see that it had even been damaged unless you look at it from certain angles. I regret to inform you that I cannot afford to fix the tablet unless I take my son out of the hobbies that he loves, so it would be a great deal if you could complete this purchase to help our family in need. I promise that when we meet to complete the purchase it will look not as bad as it sounds. Thank you.",6,5,email

And speaking of such, there is something that I'd like to ask you. The payments for my tuition aren't going to be able to be met for next quarter. I have already maxed my loans, and much of that money was used to spend on my mother's deteriorating health condition. I know you understand the pain that our family has gone through since her diagnosis, and why my parents also cannot help me with the payments because of it. Which is why I have to ask you for your help in paying for my tuition. Mother said it would be best if I asked you directly.

I know what you're thinking, and yes, she is still alive! Luckily there were no life threatening injuries which I'm glad to inform you all of!

I'm sorry I had to leave early but I had a little bit too much to drink and you know how much work I need to get done before the end of the quarter.

I will even include the case that has kept it safe! However, sometimes the audio doesn't play. This includes music and the phone's ringer, even when it is not set to silent. I know for a fact this is due to a bug in the software. I looked it up online and everyone said so. I have been saying for years they should update these things more often!

I can never seem to get ahead considering how much money they are each month. I feel guilty for asking, but I know you offered to help me years ago if ever I needed it. Does the offer still stand?

I'll get right to the point. I was driving recklessly on the freeway and hit an old lady's car. Turns out that I was an excluded on my parents, your brothers, insurance and so the insurance has denied the claim and will not pay. I'm very embarrassed to even ask but I was wondering if you would let me borrow $35,000 to pay the settlement off. I need it in two weeks because they said if I don't pay they will take me to court.  For whatever reason, they have also said that they will petition the court to take my passport, because they think I will run away. I promise I will not.

62,"It can be tough to allocate some of your cash to a savings account if you don’t have a set goal for that money. Why save for later when you can spend on what you want today, right? But among the many reasons to save money is that even if you don’t know exactly what you’re saving for right now, you’ll likely find something you want to save for in the future. A new car, a new home, a child’s education… the possibilities are endless. Plus, it’s critical to have some cash set aside for emergencies and unexpected expenses as they come up.  It has nothing to do with the money and everything to do with giving yourself flexibility and choice in your life,” says Eric Roberge, a certified financial planner and founder of Beyond Your Hammock, a financial planning firm that specializes in giving financial advice to people in their 30s.

“When you have money available in the bank you can do what you want without stress,” he says. If you’re wondering why you should save money, imagine giving yourself freedom to choose what you want to do, rather than feeling stuck in a particular situation or position because you rely on the paycheck.",12,9,email
63,"Many workers view their jobs as necessary evils to provide the resources for fulfilling their lives in leisure time, which they are pressing harder and harder to increase. It is the first-level supervisor who must cope with such workers face to face and day to day. Being able to communicate effectively is vital. In a recent study of 25 middle managers, the materials manager of an electrical company expressed a theme common to the group: “Being able to work with people is the most important characteristic a first-level supervisor can have. I can buy technological expertise, but it’s hard to find someone with good, basic communication skills.”  First-level supervisors must of course have technical competence in the areas they supervise. The supervisors must be able to perform the specific tasks they ask their workers to do and must, to some degree, understand the equipment and the process technology they manage.",12,0,email
64,"When it comes to car insurance, permissive use refers to your ability to let other motorists, ones not listed on your policy,  drive your vehicle periodically. Most standard insurance policies are permissive use.

The key word is ""periodically"" which most insurers define as less than 12 times a year. If your roommate, neighbor or friend is driving your car on a regular basis, that person should be added to your policy, which will most likely increase your premium.

There are ""named driver policies"" out there although they are fairly rare. This type of policy only covers drivers who are explicitly named on the policy. That means accidents are covered if  you let someone drive your car who is not named on your policy.

It is also possible for an insurer to lower coverage levels when an occasional driver is behind the wheel. Insurance companies in eight states are legally allowed to reduce coverage limits for any driver that is not specifically listed on your policy.",12,8,email
