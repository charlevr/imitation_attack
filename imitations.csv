1,"The only way of finding out why your partner doesn’t want to travel is by talking about travel a lot. Sometimes it may be as simple as the cost, which your partner may find prohibitive. But he or she may never say so in open for fear of being judged.\nThis happens often when you aren’t married. At this stage the financial status is still hidden, often.\nIf you think your partner is worried about the finances, speak to them. Explore travel desires that won’t burn a hole in the pocket. Show your spouse traveling options with discounts and offers on tour packages.\nIf cost is the reason, you both need to discuss it in open. Only then you will have any chance of prevailing over your partner and convincing him or her to go on a holiday. For cheap holiday packages check out Expedia, Thomas Cook, Last Minute, Cox and Kings etc.",imitator2,participant 1,email

12,"Once fall hits, everyone loves to bake, eat soup, drink hot chocolate, etc. You're loving the small chill and getting yourself into the feeling for winter, so you stop caring a little bit. During the summer it's too hot to cook, plus a lot of delicious fruits and veggies are in season. I want cool things when I'm hot. Salad, fruit, sandwiches, something light and fresh. You also drink a lot more water in the summer, which we all know you're supposed to drink a pretty hefty amount everyday year round. However, as my mom put it to me earlier, the minute it gets a little cold or the pants/sweaters come out, you sort of don't care to an extent. You want cookies, pumpkin spice everything, etc. We even have an apple orchard that makes literally the best doughnuts I've ever had and you can bet I'm going to stock up on those babies.
