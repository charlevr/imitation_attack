"During days like today, it’s important to know that you’re not alone. Unfortunately, there is no redo or undo button. But, you already knew that. I’m sure someone today told you that these troublesome days only make you stronger. And even though, in the back of your mind you believe them there’s probably a bigger part of you that just wants to self-loathe a bit. Right?\n\nGuess what, snap out of it! Or else your bad day will become bad days, a bad week or snowball into a bad month. There’s no real way to sugar coat it – stuff happens. Bad days are just one of the many elements that are part of life. Instead of honing in on the negative, think of the ways things could be worse and count your blessings.","The only way of finding out why your partner doesn’t want to travel is by talking about travel a lot.
