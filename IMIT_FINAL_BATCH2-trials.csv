"Hi, I have an excellent cell phone that I would like to sell you. It is a Beautiful Samsung Galaxy S9 plus and it works very well for its age. I would be willing to negotiate a price for you to purchase my cell phone. Please make an offer that I could not refuse. I think we could come to a reasonable price that we could agree on. The S9 Plus has amazing feautures on it. It has a really good camera, an excellent protective case and a good screen protector. With the case and screen protector it makes the phone well off. You could check it out if you wish before purchasing it. I am sure it works well. My mom also thinks it is an amazing phone and she wanted one in the past. It is just time to move on and purchase an upgrade for my phone.","Mom,I am sorry to worry you, I know you haven't been able to get in contact with me. I am in the hospital now recovering from a terrible car accident. It was bad, but please don't worry too much. I am recovering fine, and you can come visit soon if you want. I was leaving The shop at Herman's the other day. I went down the road by the pond that guy built himself. Someone pulled out from that stupid stop sign too far to check for cars. I had to swerve at the last minute to not run into him, but it was a little slippery and my car started to spin. A car coming the opposite direction ran into me and pinned my car between his and a tree. Of course it was the driver side right where I was sitting the tree hit. I had one surgery already, I got some metal in me now. The dr say I should make a good recovery.Love alwaysT",single_trial,"Allen,I am so sorry that I am late already. I know today was important. I am on my way soon if I can still do anything when I get in. Jess had to leave early for work this morning so I was in charge of the boys. I thought we were going to be fine. Everything was running smoothly and then when I went to get the boys to put them in the car Oliver told me he had swallowed a penny. I called the Dr real quick and they said that can actually be really dangerous on rare occasions, they gave me some symptoms and I went along my day. By time we got Logan to school, Oliver was just about none stop screaming in the back seat. I ended taking him to the ER and found out the penny was dissolving in his stomach and causing a reaction. I have been here with him while they get it out and treat him. He will be fine but has to stay for a while. Jess just came to relieve me and I will be in as soon as possible. again I am so sorry.Kind Regards,T",5,0,"Mom,I need the password to the paypal account. I have some bills coming up and I could use to pull some money out of it. I lost the password somewhere, you know me. I am sorry to bother you. Honestly I was also hoping to pull the money out and be able to replace it before you knew. I have looked everywhere for the password though and I just can't find it or remember it. The bill is due tommorrow and If I don't put it through soon it wont go through in time. I really need to take it from the paypal so I can have it move quickly.

"Mom, I have some bad news for you. I was driving down prairie lane last night when I went through an intersection. I thought I saw a UFO in the sky and I was hit by another car while going through the intersection. It was kind of crazy. The other driver hit me on the right side of my car. I swear I went through a green light and his was red, but I was kind of looking up in the sky and thought I saw a UFO. Anyways I am at the hospital and getting checked out but nothing is broken, just a few bumps and bruises. I am sure you will understand that the BMW is totaled probably because of that darn UFO I saw in the sky. I should sue those aliens for distracting me you know. It could be an intergalactic lawsuit.","Mom, it is very important that you listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you. I am currently in an unknown location, being held against my will. My captors have given me only one instruction. I need to transfer money from our joint account into their offshore bank account by midnight tonight or they will kill me. Please Mom, these men are serious. I need to know the password for the account and I will be able to make the wire transfer from my location with their help. If you can just do this one thing, they promised to let me go and never bother our family again. I love you so much, and I'm very sorry this is happening. I do not know these people where they came from, or why they have this motive. I would really appreciate your help, and hopefully we will be together soon safely- and happily.",single_trial,"Hi Terry, it's me. Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.",2,0,Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids? I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,You have gotten into an accident that was nearly fatal.

Hello uncle Rob. How are you doing? I am fine myself. I was wondering if I could ask for a favor as I am in a tight spot right now. I am kind in a jam you know as I was in an accident as you know and have huge hospital bills that I cannot pay. If there was anyway you could help me out as I lost a lot of wages and went to the hospital for three days. Those hospital bills are not very freindly as they cost me $25000 dollars. Could you help me out this time and pay my hospital bills. I could also work for your company for a while and go to work as I lost a lot of wages. It would be a very big help. You could pay me less and that way I could pay your back by working for your company. I would really appreciate it.,"Hi mom,I know that I said I would give you a call when I got home last night, but unfortunately, I got into a bad car accident on the way home from work. There is a blind corner behind a bush at the exit of the parking lot, and when I was pulling out, a car came flying around the corner and smashed into the driver side of the car. I have been saying for years that they need to take that bush down, and hopefully they'll finally listen! I am in the hospital now recovering, but no need to worry! I was in bad condition when I first got in, but I'm doing ok at the moment save for a few broken bones. I should be able to recover fairly soon and come back home, and I promise I will give you a call as soon as I get a chance. Just wanted to let you know so you didn't worry too much. Love you and talk to you soon!",single_trial,"Hey man,I really hate to come to you with this kind of news. I know you told me to take care of your Porsche, and I hate to say it, but I did the exact opposite. I was passing an exit ramp on the highway, and some nut job didn't see me I guess and merged over into my lane. I tried to veer out of the way, but lost control and went off the road. Of course he took off, and I couldn't get his license plate number at the time or anything so we won't be able to get him to pay for it. I'm so sorry man, but I promise that I'll cover the cost of the damages. I can drop it off at the shop near my house later today, they usually have some good deals and can get the repairs done pretty quickly. I should be able to get your car to you next week and looking as good as new!

I'm writing you an e-mail because my voice is too shaky from the pain and stress I've been through today. Earlier today, on the way to work this morning, while on the freeway I slid into the median, where my car got out of control, and crashed into a tree. The roads were very slippery from the snow and hadn't been salted yet since it was so early in the morning, around 4am. Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident. The doctors have said that I'm likely to make a full recovery, which is great news, because I almost died from the crash and they said I should be very thankful that more damage hasn't been done.

The only problem is that I kind of crashed it. As a matter of fact I crashed too well.

Anyway i didn't really pay attention to who was coming down the hill from the left. And apparently this drunken jerk was fleeing from something or someone. Just as I was pulling out the entrance, this guy came out of nowhere doing probably 80 miles an hour on the downhill, and plowed right into the left back seat towards the tire. That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER.

Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon. My sincere apologies.","You need to ask a relatively wealthy relative (it could be any relative) for some money.

I wanted to take a moment and thank you guys for doing such a great job, working so hard this past quarter, despite all the challenges and setbacks we've experienced. So I was thinking this afternoon, ""What's a great way to reward the guys for all their hard work?"" So, I decided that I would postpone our meeting for this afternoon. Instead I'm taking everyone to the outlet mall for a shopping spree on the corporate credit card. Afterwards, we'll all enjoy a four-course dinner at an upscale restaurant overlooking the riverfront.

Anyway i didn't really pay attention to who was coming down the hill from the left. And apparently this drunken jerk was fleeing from something or someone. Just as I was pulling out the entrance, this guy came out of nowhere doing probably 80 miles an hour on the downhill, and plowed right into the left back seat towards the tire. That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER.

I was only going like 10 miles over the speed limit, which is what everybody else does, so I was really going along with the rest. This car was making a left turn and hit me. He said that he had a green light, but I was already in the intersection and and that makes it I had right of the way. So clearly, it was not my fault.

I got back and still no one said they knew where it was. So when I go back to check the location, I can't because it had now been turned off. So with that said, I need access to your email.

I can explain more later but I need your password so I can accept the recovery email. thank you","Mom,I am sorry to worry you, I know you haven't been able to get in contact with me.

I had to swerve at the last minute to not run into him, but it was a little slippery and my car started to spin. A car coming the opposite direction ran into me and pinned my car between his and a tree. Of course it was the driver side right where I was sitting the tree hit.

So let me explain to you what happened. I used the company credit card while out with the interns. Now don't get mad about my lateness on top of using the card but I had a good reason. You know how the interns we just hired all went to high school with me. I couldn't miss an opportunity to impress them. Well fast forward a few hours after going bowling, I wake up at a bus station with one of the interns! Neither one of us had our phones nor wallets so we had to walk 40 miles back to her place at 4am. I took a nap because I was exhausted but of course I didn't set an alarm. Her mom woke us up and said we had to head to work, and I rushed to clean up.

I am so sorry that I arrived so late to our meeting this morning. I know it is unprofessional and I truly am sorry. I wanted to take the opportunity to explain why I was late, as I really do love this job, it means the world to me. As I was driving into work, a peacock starting crossing the road.

I cannot afford to fix the phone, so I am selling it as is. So, really, what you see is what you get. Even as it is though, someone will be very happy with this phone. You could get it fixed if the issues bother you, but it really isn't as bad as it may seem. My asking price isn't too high, and I may be willing to work with an offer.

I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help.

Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived.

With all of my school expenses, I do not have that kind of money to spare, but I do need to have my tooth fixed to avoid an infection.
