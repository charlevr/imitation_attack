Using any tactic, how would you sell your device?","Hi, I have an excellent cell phone that I would like to sell you. It is a Beautiful Samsung Galaxy S9 plus and it works very well for its age. I would be willing to negotiate a price for you to purchase my cell phone. Please make an offer that I could not refuse. I think we could come to a reasonable price that we could agree on. The S9 Plus has amazing feautures on it. It has a really good camera, an excellent protective case and a good screen protector. With the case and screen protector it makes the phone well off. You could check it out if you wish before purchasing it. I am sure it works well. My mom also thinks it is an amazing phone and she wanted one in the past. It is just time to move on and purchase an upgrade for my phone.","Mom,I am sorry to worry you, I know you haven't been able to get in contact with me. I am in the hospital now recovering from a terrible car accident. It was bad, but please don't worry too much. I am recovering fine, and you can come visit soon if you want. I was leaving The shop at Herman's the other day. I went down the road by the pond that guy built himself. Someone pulled out from that stupid stop sign too far to check for cars. I had to swerve at the last minute to not run into him, but it was a little slippery and my car started to spin. A car coming the opposite direction ran into me and pinned my car between his and a tree. Of course it was the driver side right where I was sitting the tree hit. I had one surgery already, I got some metal in me now. The dr say I should make a good recovery.Love alwaysT","Allen,I am so sorry that I am late already. I know today was important. I am on my way soon if I can still do anything when I get in. Jess had to leave early for work this morning so I was in charge of the boys. I thought we were going to be fine. Everything was running smoothly and then when I went to get the boys to put them in the car Oliver told me he had swallowed a penny. I called the Dr real quick and they said that can actually be really dangerous on rare occasions, they gave me some symptoms and I went along my day. By time we got Logan to school, Oliver was just about none stop screaming in the back seat. I ended taking him to the ER and found out the penny was dissolving in his stomach and causing a reaction. I have been here with him while they get it out and treat him. He will be fine but has to stay for a while. Jess just came to relieve me and I will be in as soon as possible. again I am so sorry.Kind Regards,T","Mom,I need the password to the paypal account.

I was driving down prairie lane last night when I went through an intersection. I thought I saw a UFO in the sky and I was hit by another car while going through the intersection. It was kind of crazy. The other driver hit me on the right side of my car. I swear I went through a green light and his was red, but I was kind of looking up in the sky and thought I saw a UFO. Anyways I am at the hospital and getting checked out but nothing is broken, just a few bumps and bruises. I am sure you will understand that the BMW is totaled probably because of that darn UFO I saw in the sky. I should sue those aliens for distracting me you know. It could be an intergalactic lawsuit.","Mom, it is very important that you listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you. I am currently in an unknown location, being held against my will. My captors have given me only one instruction. I need to transfer money from our joint account into their offshore bank account by midnight tonight or they will kill me. Please Mom, these men are serious. I need to know the password for the account and I will be able to make the wire transfer from my location with their help. If you can just do this one thing, they promised to let me go and never bother our family again. I love you so much, and I'm very sorry this is happening.

Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.",Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids?

You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,single_trial,0

I am fine myself. I was wondering if I could ask for a favor as I am in a tight spot right now. I am kind in a jam you know as I was in an accident as you know and have huge hospital bills that I cannot pay. If there was anyway you could help me out as I lost a lot of wages and went to the hospital for three days. Those hospital bills are not very freindly as they cost me $25000 dollars. Could you help me out this time and pay my hospital bills. I could also work for your company for a while and go to work as I lost a lot of wages. It would be a very big help. You could pay me less and that way I could pay your back by working for your company.

There is a blind corner behind a bush at the exit of the parking lot, and when I was pulling out, a car came flying around the corner and smashed into the driver side of the car. I have been saying for years that they need to take that bush down, and hopefully they'll finally listen! I am in the hospital now recovering, but no need to worry!

I was passing an exit ramp on the highway, and some nut job didn't see me I guess and merged over into my lane. I tried to veer out of the way, but lost control and went off the road. Of course he took off, and I couldn't get his license plate number at the time or anything so we won't be able to get him to pay for it.

I know you haven't heard from me since yesterday and I'm going to explain to you why. Please just don't freak out about this! I'm writing you an e-mail because my voice is too shaky from the pain and stress I've been through today. Earlier today, on the way to work this morning, while on the freeway I slid into the median, where my car got out of control, and crashed into a tree. The roads were very slippery from the snow and hadn't been salted yet since it was so early in the morning, around 4am. Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident. The doctors have said that I'm likely to make a full recovery, which is great news, because I almost died from the crash and they said I should be very thankful that more damage hasn't been done. I will call you later when I'm ready to talk.

Knowing that the meeting was at our downtown office, I stopped by the main office at 8:30am this morning to grab some last minute paperwork. While I was there, though, the electricity cut to the office. It immediately came back on - but it was clear that some of the internet capabilities did not immediately register back on. I had to call the Internet company and see what was going on. That took another 20 minutes. By the time I got that sorted out, got to the car, and drove the 10 minutes to the downtown office, the meeting had already begun. I apologize for the late arrival - but I couldn't let the main office go without Internet in the early day!Best, Employee","This tablet is being sold AS-IS for PARTS or REPAIR. The screen is shattered but it's still functional. All of the apps and features can still be accessed. I'm the only owner and I bought it new only a year ago. It's not on a contract and is pretty simple to use. The charging port works and I will include a clean case and original charger. BUT it will take about $300 to fully fix the screen. (That's the quote given by Local Repair Shop.) My loss is your gain! The tablet itself can be yours for only $50. So if you pay for the repair, that's $350 total - when the tablet NEW runs for $1200, that's a pretty good deal. No refunds, no returns, you are buying as-is.

Your email was opened on your laptop, so I peeked. I know I shouldn't have, but I was concerned. I would've just closed the email window, but the email you had opened was a phishing email. I have no idea if you actually went into your retirement account using that link. Did you? This is urgent. These keylogging sites can do a lot of damage. I need to know what other sites you have visited, and which accounts you have accessed. I can get it from the history, but I wanted to get your permission before I do this. So write me back ASAP. And the retirement account's email and and the password will both need to be changed ASAP. And the other accounts that might have been compromised also. Write me back immediately with your passwords or call me. IMMEDIATELY!!!!","Hey mom. I know you heard. Yes, I got into an accident. And yes, it damn near killed me. Totaled the car. Let me explain so you don't worry. I am a O.K. OK? So yesterday, I was pulling out of the school entrance in the back near the sign. You know what I'm talking about? Anyway i didn't really pay attention to who was coming down the hill from the left. And apparently this drunken jerk was fleeing from something or someone. Just as I was pulling out the entrance, this guy came out of nowhere doing probably 80 miles an hour on the downhill, and plowed right into the left back seat towards the tire. That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER. And NO need to drive 500 miles or fly here, mom. I'm OK. Doctors said so. Don't worry, and I'll see next month for Thanskgiving. And yes, I am coming.","Dear Mr Boss, I just wanted to let you know I am on my way to the meeting as we speak. I had to be in an emergency room helping out a neighbor get treatment. Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon. My sincere apologies.",single_trial,3

However, there are a few things you should know first. The computer itself is not functional in its current state. This is why I've decided to sell it for parts. Additionally, you'll be happy to know that my computer is going for the low, low price of $3.50. That's right, you two can have the luxury of a previously owned, horribly conditioned, archaic laptop computer. I bet you're wondering why I'm selling the computer. In this past year I've become a minimalist but also an environmentalist. In an effort to avoid recycling something that could be refurbished, I've decided to sell it but for a low price so that I definitely find a good home.","Mom you are never going to believe what just happened to me! I was so scared! I'm so glad everything's okay, but I just need to calm down. I was driving along the interstate and I was just about to go through the tunnel. I had stopped at the light which is a long light as you know, and I was busy adjusting the stereo. It was raining very hard outside and my car was fogging up so I took an extra few minutes to wipe off the inside of the windshield. I sat there a few minutes peacefully enjoying the jazz music and I noticed the green reflection of the light on the dashboard. Normally I would just press the gas pedal and go because I'm in a hurry, but instead I hesitated and I looked to the left. I am so happy I did this. I am so happy that I wasn't in any hurry today.

Needless to say I'm okay, A little shaken up, but I'd love you and just wanted to let you know.","Hi team, I've recently checked our data from this quarter and it looks like everything's on target just like we planned. I wanted to take a moment and thank you guys for doing such a great job, working so hard this past quarter, despite all the challenges and setbacks we've experienced. So I was thinking this afternoon, ""What's a great way to reward the guys for all their hard work?"" So, I decided that I would postpone our meeting for this afternoon. Instead I'm taking everyone to the outlet mall for a shopping spree on the corporate credit card. Afterwards, we'll all enjoy a four-course dinner at an upscale restaurant overlooking the riverfront.

Totaled the car. Let me explain so you don't worry. I am a O.K. OK? So yesterday, I was pulling out of the school entrance in the back near the sign. You know what I'm talking about? Anyway i didn't really pay attention to who was coming down the hill from the left. And apparently this drunken jerk was fleeing from something or someone. Just as I was pulling out the entrance, this guy came out of nowhere doing probably 80 miles an hour on the downhill, and plowed right into the left back seat towards the tire. That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER.

So I go online and use the tracking information to find the phone because it was still on. Come to find out it was still at the party. Sweet right? no. I got back and still no one said they knew where it was. So when I go back to check the location, I can't because it had now been turned off. So with that said, I need access to your email. You are the recovery email so I can log activate my new phone. I can explain more later but I need your password so I can accept the recovery email. thank you","Mom,I am sorry to worry you, I know you haven't been able to get in contact with me. I am in the hospital now recovering from a terrible car accident. It was bad, but please don't worry too much. I am recovering fine, and you can come visit soon if you want. I was leaving The shop at Herman's the other day. I went down the road by the pond that guy built himself. Someone pulled out from that stupid stop sign too far to check for cars. I had to swerve at the last minute to not run into him, but it was a little slippery and my car started to spin. A car coming the opposite direction ran into me and pinned my car between his and a tree. Of course it was the driver side right where I was sitting the tree hit. I had one surgery already, I got some metal in me now. The dr say I should make a good recovery.Love alwaysT","Jason,I am so sorry to have to tell you this.

They towed the car down to Ron's. I don't think any of us are going to fix it, but that is where it is if you want to go see it. I just can't apologize enough.

You know I will get it back to you the best I can. I have a $1000 payment due on the first. If I really cut it close on groceries I can make about half of it, any amount would help me.

I would never act like it wasn't, even with my history of attendance issues. So let me explain to you what happened. I used the company credit card while out with the interns. Now don't get mad about my lateness on top of using the card but I had a good reason. You know how the interns we just hired all went to high school with me. I couldn't miss an opportunity to impress them. Well fast forward a few hours after going bowling, I wake up at a bus station with one of the interns! Neither one of us had our phones nor wallets so we had to walk 40 miles back to her place at 4am. I took a nap because I was exhausted but of course I didn't set an alarm. Her mom woke us up and said we had to head to work, and I rushed to clean up. I'll pay you back for money spent with the company card, I promise.","Mom, it is very important that you listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.","Hi team, I've recently checked our data from this quarter and it looks like everything's on target just like we planned.

So I was thinking this afternoon, ""What's a great way to reward the guys for all their hard work?"" So, I decided that I would postpone our meeting for this afternoon. Instead I'm taking everyone to the outlet mall for a shopping spree on the corporate credit card. Afterwards, we'll all enjoy a four-course dinner at an upscale restaurant overlooking the riverfront.

So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.

This error has caused a lot losses, and I have been given explicit instruction from the VP to identify the source of the error, and deal with it myself personally. if I don't, I have been informed that he will fire the individual, and then demote me.  As you can all see, this is a serious problem for our department, and we should plan for the worst, ie., termination of the employment of the individual(s) responsible, and perhaps even those who might have been aware of the negligence. Further instructions will follow.","Hey Mom, EMERGENCY!!!!! You know you've been hacked? Your email was opened on your laptop, so I peeked. I know I shouldn't have, but I was concerned.

I was extremely lucky to be one of the last employees laid off, but I now find myself in a terrible situation. Do you remember that you used to tell me that I could come to you if I needed anything whatsoever? Well now I need to ask you a favor since I have nobody else to turn to. If at all possible, could you please lend me some money to help me get by for the next couple of months? While I do not want to burden you, I am very responsible and I will make sure to repay you as soon as possible. If so, could you please send the money to my bank account as soon as possible so my rent is covered and I'll be good to go for the month?","Hi mom, sorry I missed dinner the other night. As you know we live in Southern California and people tend to panic when a little bit of precipitation happens. I was going to the grocery store to pick up a bottle of wine when people started panicking at the sight of a puddle on the road and swerving to avoid it. My windshield wipers were stuck and I was trying to fix them when I noticed the bottleneck and hit the brakes, but the water on the ground meant that the tires were not able to fully stop in time to avoid needing to swerve off the road. I was extremely lucky in that there were no trees or people near me, and I left with a few bumps and bruises but if there was anything in the road it could have been a far different story!","First of all, I don't even know where to start. I will start with my insurance will cover any damages in full, if the party at fault does not have the insurance to cover the accident. With that said, it is my firm belief that the damages are solely their fault in full and the accident investigation will support my belief. I understand this car was your first big purchase after you were promoted and it has substantial sentimental value for you, and for that I am extremely sorry. I was extremely cautious when parking it, and parked away from the rest of the cars in the lot, but unfortunately that meant that cars were passing by it at a faster speed and the car that clipped you was going faster than otherwise. I will make sure that all damages are covered and we are good to go!","Mom, remember when I was younger and we had to set up my account in your name because the bank would not let a minor have the primary on the credit card? Well now I want to make a purchase in my name, but the bank is refusing to let me have custody of the account since your name is still on it. I want to make a large purchase, and in the end I don't want you to be liable for the expense so can you please send me the password so I can start the paperwork to transition the account from your name and mine to just mine? I am 22 now and am ready for the responsibility, thank you for putting your name on the account when I was younger and I want to be an adult and take responsibility for my charges.",single_trial,12

I'm sorry to have to do this via email, but I know that you read your email more often than you answer phone calls. I was recently in a car accident, but unfortunately, I was found at fault and my insurance company will not cover any damages. My car was totaled and I currently have no transportation to get to or from work. I do not have any extra money, and I need access to the funds I had saved in that bank account which is still under your name. If at all possible, could you please provide me with the password to the account so that I can access the funds for this emergency situation?

I unfortunately had some personal things come up and need to cancel.  Your time is very valuable to me, and I only do this because there is absolutely no other option I have here.  I'm going to look to reschedule it until 7:30 PM.  That should give me enough time to wrap up what just came up and get back here to talk to you about the harassment claims going on in this company.  I am taking this issue incredibly serious, and I am setting aside as much time as possible to deal with it when I return, you will have my ear until you feel your concerns have been heard.  We take this very seriously, and we will do everything we can to address it, I just hope you aren't too upset I need to push it back.","Hey Aunt Esme.  I'm sorry to do this via email, but I haven't been able to reach your phone, and I know your business email gets checked hourly.  I hate to ask ANYONE for money, but especially you after everything you've done for our family.  But, Dad fell down and hurt himself pretty bad at work, the insurance won't cover the surgery needed to fix his back.  It's an emergency situation, and they said that they need to do it immediately to prevent permanent damage to him. I have already raised a good portion of the money from my own bank account, and friends, but we're still short $3,000.  The doctor will not start the surgery without it.  If at all possible, you have my venmo, please Aunt Esme!  I'll do everything in my power to pay it back to you as soon as possible, but this is about my dad's future.  I need your help.Love,Your Nephew.","Hi Mom.  Well, I know you get very upset when something bad happens to me out of my control, so I'm going to tell you some bad news right now.  Before we go on, yes, I'm not in great shape, I was in a car accident.  I was on the highway at night, a drunk driver came out of NOWHERE and smashed into me.  He sideswiped me good, the Kia Optima is totaled, and I'm still recovering from the damage it did to me.  Thankfully, there were some good folks around who called the police, checked on me, made sure I was alright, one of them even stayed at the hospital until Dad got here just so I wasn't alone.  It was a near miss, and I don't want to scare you, but I always try to be honest, things could have ended a lot worse.  I'm going to be holed up at Holy Name Hospital a few days, I can explain a little better in person, but this was the simplest, fastest way to let you know since you never answer your phone.

I was on the furthest left lane and it just so happened that someone ran a red light from the left side of the road and rammed into my car. The car is wrecked. They hit the driver's side and I ended up having to go to the hospital. The impact of the crash was so bad that the emergency services had to be called to open my door.

First I'd like to take the opportunity to sincerely apologize for my late arrival at this morning this morning's meeting. Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids?

You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school.

If you could just e-mail or text me, both the username and password on the savings account, that would be all I'd need.

I was tossing and turning all night from the stress of possibly losing the best job I've ever had. If there's anything at all I can do to make it up to you, sir, I will do it. I will show you how much dedication I have for this company. The e-mail you sent me yesterday, asking if I think this company is a joke, could not be farther from the truth. I will put forth all of my time and energy to prove to you, and to prove to everyone else in this company, that I don't see this company as a joke. I want to show you how truly dedicated I am. Please, just give me another chance, and I will make it up to you and to this company.Sincerely,Ashleigh","Hello Aunt Sharon,How are you doing? I'm so sorry that it's been so long since we've talked. Let's catch up on the phone soon. Now, the reason I haven't been in touch is because I've had a hard time with my financial situation, and unfortunately might have to quit college. You know how I had that sales manager job? Well, they went out of business so now I'm out of the job, and I haven't been able to find a new one yet. I would be so disappointed in myself if I had to quit college, especially because you know my dream is to be a vet tech. I can't continue paying my rent here if I don't come up with some money soon. If you could lend me about $500, it would mean the world to me because I'd have another month to look for a job, and I wouldn't have to quit college! If you can, just send it to my Paypal email. Thanks so much for reading this and I hope you'll consider loaning me the money. Love you Aunt Sharon!",single_trial,14

My windshield wipers were stuck and I was trying to fix them when I noticed the bottleneck and hit the brakes, but the water on the ground meant that the tires were not able to fully stop in time to avoid needing to swerve off the road.

The retail price for one at the moment is $90.  I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.

I got it shortly after the latest model was released and haven't had any problems with it. Just recently, it was dropped and there is a small crack in the screen. It has not affected the functionality of the phone, but I had an estimate to get the screen replaced. The cost is low but, since my contract allows for a new phone this year, I do not wish to spend the extra money on this one. For that reason, I will sell this phone for a bit below its value, allowing for replacement of the cracked screen if you so wish. This phone's speed is quite good and it takes high-quality photos. If the screen crack does not bother you, you can get this phone at a great price!","Mom, remember when I was younger and we had to set up my account in your name because the bank would not let a minor have the primary on the credit card?

My windshield wipers were stuck and I was trying to fix them when I noticed the bottleneck and hit the brakes, but the water on the ground meant that the tires were not able to fully stop in time to avoid needing to swerve off the road.

I went to the club down the street here, and drove around the block several times before I found a spot big enough to park the car - and leave space front and back - but not enough space to fit other cars! I double-checked my parking and went into the club for a few hours. When I came out, I found the car still in the spot, but with the side smashed in. It looks like someone hit it broadside. I could not open the door on the driver's side, and could not get it started when I got inside. I had it towed and I am waiting for an estimate.

I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,"Hi Terry, it's me.

For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.","Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I have a fantastic, yet old, computer that I am dying to get rid of.

If your roommate, neighbor or friend is driving your car on a regular basis, that person should be added to your policy, which will most likely increase your premium.

There are ""named driver policies"" out there although they are fairly rare. This type of policy only covers drivers who are explicitly named on the policy. That means accidents are covered if  you let someone drive your car who is not named on your policy.

It is also possible for an insurer to lower coverage levels when an occasional driver is behind the wheel. Insurance companies in eight states are legally allowed to reduce coverage limits for any driver that is not specifically listed on your policy",hey mom i need to ask you a favor i need your google password. i have some accounts with some older social media websites and there are a lot of pictures i want of me and all my friends from back when we were teenagers and i cant remember the passwords. all the accounts are all linked o your google account so when i go to cant remember password it wants to send the recovery link to you. i didn't just want to try to login to you google account without asking you. i know it is kind of a weird request its just nowadays all these sites take security so seriously. it will only take a few seconds and i promise to only look at the emails i need that will be sent from the social media websites. thanks mom.,hey uncle frank. i got your message about my cousin Marissa. i am so proud of her.

I am willing to let it go for less than I was originally trying to get because I know how much you want them for the kids.

I am selling a Kindle Fire Tablet.  The retail price for one at the moment is $90.  I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!","Hello there co-workers and friends!  I'm sorry this is short notice, I know we had a meeting today in the green room at 6:00 PM.

I need half of the tuition in 2 weeks in order to not be dropped from my classes for the term, and I am not sure where else to turn. Would you be able to give me a loan for the outstanding balance and I will repay you back monthly over the next 2 years as I am able to get the money saved?

Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably.

That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER. And NO need to drive 500 miles or fly here, mom. I'm OK. Doctors said so. Don't worry, and I'll see next month for Thanskgiving. And yes, I am coming.","Almost brand new smartphone for sale.

What had happened was that my son, who will be unable to attend his martial arts lessons in the future if I am not able to raise funds in time, had gotten a hold of the tablet and charged it with the incorrect voltage charger.

I'm very ashamed to tell you that I was out with a friend, one who I no longer associate with, and he had been under the influence when driving us home. One moment I'm laughing with him in the car, the next moment I wake up in a hospital bed with several tubes attached to me. I'm so so sorry to tell you about this under these circumstances.

I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,Good morning gentleman. First I'd like to take the opportunity to sincerely apologize for my late arrival at this morning this morning's meeting. Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,"Hi Terry, it's me. Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.",single_trial,20

It's unbelievable the work load that my current professors are putting us under. You'd think with all the money that we pay for our education we would be allowed to focus more on learning rather than menial busy work. And speaking of such, there is something that I'd like to ask you. The payments for my tuition aren't going to be able to be met for next quarter. I have already maxed my loans, and much of that money was used to spend on my mother's deteriorating health condition. I know you understand the pain that our family has gone through since her diagnosis, and why my parents also cannot help me with the payments because of it. Which is why I have to ask you for your help in paying for my tuition. Mother said it would be best if I asked you directly. I promise if you help us with this I will pay you back in full when I have graduated and have a paying job.

I must have caught it at the holiday party, I can't believe that people still went even though they were sick! Anyways, we'll have to push the meeting back until I get better, which will probably be next week.

I am dropping the price down to $400 since, even though the screen and most of it is in like new condition, there is a problem with the charger port that would require a repair to fix.

I know what you're thinking, and yes, she is still alive! Luckily there were no life threatening injuries which I'm glad to inform you all of!

I'm writing you an e-mail because my voice is too shaky from the pain and stress I've been through today. Earlier today, on the way to work this morning, while on the freeway I slid into the median, where my car got out of control, and crashed into a tree. The roads were very slippery from the snow and hadn't been salted yet since it was so early in the morning, around 4am. Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident. The doctors have said that I'm likely to make a full recovery, which is great news, because I almost died from the crash and they said I should be very thankful that more damage hasn't been done. I will call you later when I'm ready to talk. Love you, mom!","To Mr. Brown whomever it may concern,I hope you are well, sir, and I pray that you will read this e-mail to let me explain myself for being late to the meeting yesterday.

I will put forth all of my time and energy to prove to you, and to prove to everyone else in this company, that I don't see this company as a joke. I want to show you how truly dedicated I am.

All of the apps and features can still be accessed. I'm the only owner and I bought it new only a year ago. It's not on a contract and is pretty simple to use. The charging port works and I will include a clean case and original charger. BUT it will take about $300 to fully fix the screen. (That's the quote given by Local Repair Shop.) My loss is your gain! The tablet itself can be yours for only $50. So if you pay for the repair, that's $350 total - when the tablet NEW runs for $1200, that's a pretty good deal. No refunds, no returns, you are buying as-is. I will bring the device charged so that you can try it before you buy.","Dear colleagues, In regards to the meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow at noon, I'm afraid we'll have to postpone it until early next week.

That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,"Mom, it is very important that you listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

I am so excited that I heard from you. I hope you're doing well! My mom and I were just talking about you yesterday and saying we hoped you were alright. Anyway, since you did ask how I am, I admit I am not doing quite as well as I would like, Aunt Bertha. I am making okay money from my job, but my student loan payments are absolutely terrible. I can never seem to get ahead considering how much money they are each month. I feel guilty for asking, but I know you offered to help me years ago if ever I needed it. Does the offer still stand? Even being able to pay down $10,000 of my loans at once would put me in a much more stable position. I can send you the details of the loan so you can even pay it directly.

I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!","Hey Mom, you know how you always ask me what are some hot buys on Amazon?  Well, I was going to add a bunch of stuff to your cart so you could see, but unfortunately, I don't have your login info.

If you give me your login, Ill fix up your account, put your new address in there, and take care of the account I set up for you to get it all running smoothly.  It shouldn't take long, and if you really want, can change the password right after I finish.

Before we go on, yes, I'm not in great shape, I was in a car accident.  I was on the highway at night, a drunk driver came out of NOWHERE and smashed into me.  He sideswiped me good, the Kia Optima is totaled, and I'm still recovering from the damage it did to me.  Thankfully, there were some good folks around who called the police, checked on me, made sure I was alright, one of them even stayed at the hospital until Dad got here just so I wasn't alone.  It was a near miss, and I don't want to scare you, but I always try to be honest, things could have ended a lot worse.

You have the password and it will not let me change it. Now that I am 18 I would like to keep an eye on things so I can try to be responsible.

I will start with my insurance will cover any damages in full, if the party at fault does not have the insurance to cover the accident. With that said, it is my firm belief that the damages are solely their fault in full and the accident investigation will support my belief. I understand this car was your first big purchase after you were promoted and it has substantial sentimental value for you, and for that I am extremely sorry. I was extremely cautious when parking it, and parked away from the rest of the cars in the lot, but unfortunately that meant that cars were passing by it at a faster speed and the car that clipped you was going faster than otherwise.

As you know we live in Southern California and people tend to panic when a little bit of precipitation happens. I was going to the grocery store to pick up a bottle of wine when people started panicking at the sight of a puddle on the road and swerving to avoid it. My windshield wipers were stuck and I was trying to fix them when I noticed the bottleneck and hit the brakes, but the water on the ground meant that the tires were not able to fully stop in time to avoid needing to swerve off the road. I was extremely lucky in that there were no trees or people near me, and I left with a few bumps and bruises but if there was anything in the road it could have been a far different story!","Hi all, my deepest apologies for the late notice but it has come to my attention that I will need to push back our team meeting this afternoon.

I have to push back our meeting. I know this is very short notice and the timing is horrible, but I have had a late shipment come into the loading dock. As you know, as warehouse supervisor, standard protocol requires me to stay and do inventory on the stock before I can put it into our supply system. This is to prevent theft, being shortchanged by our manufacturer, and other troublesome events. The late shipment is due to the holiday season and the mail and shipment companies being overloaded. The total time needed for the inventory will take two hours. I have some extra help so maybe a little sooner than that. I am sorry for the inconvenience. I will be in touch soon","hello thank you for responding. yes the phone is still for sale. and i am still very motivated to sell it. it is a brand new iphone.

OK, they're ripped and compressed, so it will not be exactly HD DVD quality, but very close. It's so convenient to watch movies on your phone while riding in public transportation. Just the movies alone will cost anyone looking to buy such thing hefty money. And I'm including it for free with the phone. I paid 750 for it early this year. And I'm only asking 500 for it.

Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.",Good morning gentleman. First I'd like to take the opportunity to sincerely apologize for my late arrival at this morning this morning's meeting. Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,single_trial,25

","It can be tough to allocate some of your cash to a savings account if you don’t have a set goal for that money. Why save for later when you can spend on what you want today, right? But among the many reasons to save money is that even if you don’t know exactly what you’re saving for right now, you’ll likely find something you want to save for in the future. A new car, a new home, a child’s education… the possibilities are endless. Plus, it’s critical to have some cash set aside for emergencies and unexpected expenses as they come up.  It has nothing to do with the money and everything to do with giving yourself flexibility and choice in your life,” says Eric Roberge, a certified financial planner and founder of Beyond Your Hammock, a financial planning firm that specializes in giving financial advice to people in their 30s.

“When you have money available in the bank you can do what you want without stress,” he says. If you’re wondering why you should save money, imagine giving yourself freedom to choose what you want to do, rather than feeling stuck in a particular situation or position because you rely on the paycheck.","Good afternoon sir,I am terribly sorry that I am so behind in getting to the meeting today, but unfortunately, my daughter was in bad condition this morning and she fainted, and we had to rush her to the emergency room.

It is the first-level supervisor who must cope with such workers face to face and day to day. Being able to communicate effectively is vital. In a recent study of 25 middle managers, the materials manager of an electrical company expressed a theme common to the group: “Being able to work with people is the most important characteristic a first-level supervisor can have. I can buy technological expertise, but it’s hard to find someone with good, basic communication skills.”  First-level supervisors must of course have technical competence in the areas they supervise. The supervisors must be able to perform the specific tasks they ask their workers to do and must, to some degree, understand the equipment and the process technology they manage.","Hi mom,I'm emailing you from my college dorm right now, and I was just informed that my school tuition loan is on stand-by for right now.

What do you do?,"When it comes to car insurance, permissive use refers to your ability to let other motorists, ones not listed on your policy,  drive your vehicle periodically. Most standard insurance policies are permissive use.

The key word is ""periodically"" which most insurers define as less than 12 times a year. If your roommate, neighbor or friend is driving your car on a regular basis, that person should be added to your policy, which will most likely increase your premium.

There are ""named driver policies"" out there although they are fairly rare. This type of policy only covers drivers who are explicitly named on the policy. That means accidents are covered if  you let someone drive your car who is not named on your policy.

It is also possible for an insurer to lower coverage levels when an occasional driver is behind the wheel. Insurance companies in eight states are legally allowed to reduce coverage limits for any driver that is not specifically listed on your policy.","Hey Mom, How are things going? I need your help!

I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,single_trial,27

I had some great finds - including a small dining room table, which I packed safely in the back of the Flex.

And now, the only daycare with immediate openings wants a $500 deposit...and that's just too much for my husband and I to afford right now. Would you be able to help us out?

The honest truth is that it will need some work to whoever buys it. I could really use any money I could get for it. It was my sons tablet for playing games on. I was thinking if anyone was interested, I could throw in his google play account with all his games on it. He doesn't play most of them anymore, at least not on that account. He has quite a bit of progress on Mine craft and Roblox both. His prized possession on there was his call of duty account. I don't know a lot about it you would have to talk to him.

But, Dad fell down and hurt himself pretty bad at work, the insurance won't cover the surgery needed to fix his back.  It's an emergency situation, and they said that they need to do it immediately to prevent permanent damage to him. I have already raised a good portion of the money from my own bank account, and friends, but we're still short $3,000.  The doctor will not start the surgery without it.  If at all possible, you have my venmo, please Aunt Esme!  I'll do everything in my power to pay it back to you as soon as possible, but this is about my dad's future.

I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,single_trial,34

Create a story for why you were late that will convince them not to fire you. ,"Hello team and bosses. To preface this message, I must extend my sincerest apologies for my tardiness today. There is no excuse for it, and no amount of explaining can ever make it up to you. However, I do hope you can sympathize with my plight and grant me some leeway on this occasion. My grandmother has been battling some illnesses for many months including a respiratory and heart condition. There was a grave call from her doctor informing me, her emergency contact, that she was brought to the hospital on the morning of the crucial meeting we had scheduled. I had a terrible choice to make: visit my grandmother, who could have passed away but fortunately didn't, or not go see her and make it to the meeting.","Hello, how have you been? It's been a while since we've talked! I hope all is well with you and the family. I actually wanted to talk to you because I am finally thinking of starting a beer brewing business and was wondering if you'd be interested in investing. I know, after all these years, I finally want to turn my hobby into a profession! I am thinking of going to the bank to get a loan, but wanted to see if you would be interested in helping me get started first before I do that. I have a couple other co founders who are all ready to go, so we're planning to get the process going in a few weeks, so I would need to know fairly soon. If you're interested, let me know, and any form of payment would be greatly appreciated (if you wanted to write a check, or just directly pay for some of the materials we'd need to get started). You would obviously be a partial owner as well, and we can figure those details out when we get started. Hope to hear from you soon!","Good morning team,I know we have our quarterly kickoff meeting scheduled for today, but unfortunately I'm not going to be able to make it into the office. I've been feeling sick lately, and felt really terrible this morning. I went to the doctor and it turns out that I have the flu. I must have caught it at the holiday party, I can't believe that people still went even though they were sick! Anyways, we'll have to push the meeting back until I get better, which will probably be next week. In the meantime, think about how you want to set up our schedule for the next quarter so that we can get everything done on time, so that when we have our meeting next week we can get through everything as efficiently as possible.Sorry again, and see you all next week!","Hey man,I really hate to come to you with this kind of news. I know you told me to take care of your Porsche, and I hate to say it, but I did the exact opposite. I was passing an exit ramp on the highway, and some nut job didn't see me I guess and merged over into my lane. I tried to veer out of the way, but lost control and went off the road. Of course he took off, and I couldn't get his license plate number at the time or anything so we won't be able to get him to pay for it. I'm so sorry man, but I promise that I'll cover the cost of the damages. I can drop it off at the shop near my house later today, they usually have some good deals and can get the repairs done pretty quickly. I should be able to get your car to you next week and looking as good as new! Sorry again, and I promise I'll take care of it!",single_trial,36

This is almost impossible for me to talk about but I need to get it out there. There is no way I can ever apologize enough for what happened. So many factors led to the car accident that I don't even know where to begin with explaining it.

All I can now, and all I will continue to say is that I am so, so sorry. If the accident had been fatal, which it almost was, you would have been devastated and it would have been all my fault. I shouldn't have ran the stop sign, and I shouldn't have been going 60 MPH on a 30 MPH road. My friends and I had too much to drink and were not thinking straight. We were being foolish and it almost cost everything.","Hey man. I don't even know where I'm going to start. I've always been an idiot. You know that.

I was jack-knifed by this crazy dude who ran the red light. But it appears he didn't insurance, so either your insurance pays for it, or I pay for it. and... I don't have money. I'm unemployed man, why did you think I had to borrow your car? Now I now you wish I was dead. I understand. I'll make it up to you. Once I find a job, and get settled, I will buy you the same make and model. I swear. Meanwhile, you might have to file the report saying the car is totaled. Not sure how this is going to go down.

So first I wanted to say thank you so much for letting me borrow your car today! I really needed it! You're the best for lending it to me. Now please don't get mad at me. But I need to tell you something. I got into a car accident while I was driving your car! I'm sorry I really am. I swear it wasn't my fault! I was being so SO careful driving. I know you love that car. I would never drive it without being careful.  But this guy totally ran a red light and made me swerve. Then I crashed into another car at the intersection. The damage is pretty bad. They had to tow it away. I had to call an Uber to get home. I just want to say I'm sorry again! I'd pay for it but I really have no money right now. You already know that though, that's why I had to borrow your car! But you have really good insurance right? So it should cover all the damage. It was such a crazy accident. I promise I was so careful. There was nothing I could do to avoid it! Thanks and sorry again. You're the best!",Hey mom! I know this my worry you but  I just got into an horrible accident! I am such a klutz but I thankfully survived too bad my car was totalled. I was driving on my way to jessica's house to see her son's third birthday party. And I was crossing an intersection when a run away truck zoomed through a red light and hit my car sending it swerving over onto its side into a grassy area. I was absolutely terrified when it happened. but before I knew it I had completely blacked out. but I assume while I was someone had called an ambulance and I had gotten taken to the hospital with quite a few injuries. It was absolutely crazy. but I am here! Thank god for that. Your little girl wouldnt leave this planet so easily,I know I  am late but you honestly would not believe what had happened to me! It was such a shock. so Here is my story. Well first thing first I was dead set on making my way into work when a deer ran infront of my vehicle and I almost hit it! BUt I didnt I came to a stop at the right moment but the deer stayed in front of my car. I beeped at it but it did not move. I then noticed movement behind it . It had a baby behind it. But the baby was on the ground It would not stand up. I then noticed It was bleeding a bit. Being the kind individual I am I looked up numbers for places that help wildlife. I then called in. And requested for someone to come out and help the poor fawn. After a while of waiting Somebody came down and took the fawn away with the mother. You see so thats why I was late.,Hello My relative. I would like to request some money from you if thats ok? I will be needing about eight thousand. I will need it for a car I've been wanting to buy so I will not be reliant on uber. You know how expensive that can be so eight thousand would help a bunch! I'd be greatful from the very bottom of my heart If i can get it. And I promise to pay you back.

It's not easy news to hear, so I just want to tell you first that I'm okay and please don't freak out.  A couple of days ago, I was driving to the grocery store and being very cautious on the road as usual.  I was stopped at an intersection and when the light turned green, I started to move forward. Then out of nowhere, this guy ran the red light and rammed right into me. It was actually a very bad accident and my car was completely smashed.  They had to take my car apart to get me out and I was in critical condition for the past two days.  Today I'm finally well enough to update people on what happened. I'm sorry that you had to find out this way, but since I was on break from work and with me living alone, nobody knew what had happened. I'm ok though. I'll talk to you soon. Love, your daughter.","Dear Jessica,I'm so sorry that I'm sending you an e-mail instead of a proper phone call, but honestly I don't know how I can speak the words out loud. This morning on the way to work, I was on an icy road and although I was slowed down, there was another car who was driving too fast and crashed right into the back of your car. I think the car might totaled, which breaks my heart, because you trusted me to take excellent care of your car. I completely betrayed your trust by crashing your expensive car. Don't worry, Jessica, I'll help you call the insurance company and see what we can do about a possible repair or replacement. Unfortunately, I don't have much money to my name so I can't pay you for the car, but we will get this figured out! I promise! I'm so sorry, and I love you so much, and I hope you can forgive me.Love Your Friend,Ashleigh","To whomever it may concern,Unfortunately, I'm going to have to reschedule that important meeting that we had scheduled for today at 3:30.

I know this meeting was important but my son got expelled from school today for missing too many classes, and I need to speak with the Principal of his school and my wife, and figure out what to do next. Right now, I need to be with my family and as I always tell you all, family should always come first.

Take care, and I'll see you all at work on Friday!","Hi mom,I'm emailing you from my college dorm right now, and I was just informed that my school tuition loan is on stand-by for right now. I inquired about it and it turns out that all I need is to give them my proof of income, which is in that savings account you made for me. Now, I just need to log in so I can show the financial administrator my bank statements. That is all I need now for my school loans to be approved. If you could just e-mail or text me, both the username and password on the savings account, that would be all I'd need. It is important that I get that information as soon as possible, so that I'll get my school loan as quick as possible. I missed the e-mail about my loan being on stand-by earlier last month, so it's very important that you send that info to me as soon as you see this! Thanks, mom. Love you!",single_trial,38

I will start with my insurance will cover any damages in full, if the party at fault does not have the insurance to cover the accident. With that said, it is my firm belief that the damages are solely their fault in full and the accident investigation will support my belief. I understand this car was your first big purchase after you were promoted and it has substantial sentimental value for you, and for that I am extremely sorry. I was extremely cautious when parking it, and parked away from the rest of the cars in the lot, but unfortunately that meant that cars were passing by it at a faster speed and the car that clipped you was going faster than otherwise. I will make sure that all damages are covered and we are good to go!","Mom, remember when I was younger and we had to set up my account in your name because the bank would not let a minor have the primary on the credit card?

So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!","Hello there co-workers and friends!  I'm sorry this is short notice, I know we had a meeting today in the green room at 6:00 PM.  I unfortunately had some personal things come up and need to cancel.  Your time is very valuable to me, and I only do this because there is absolutely no other option I have here.  I'm going to look to reschedule it until 7:30 PM.  That should give me enough time to wrap up what just came up and get back here to talk to you about the harassment claims going on in this company.  I am taking this issue incredibly serious, and I am setting aside as much time as possible to deal with it when I return, you will have my ear until you feel your concerns have been heard.

That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95. Hi team, I've recently checked our data from this quarter and it looks like everything's on target just like we planned. I wanted to take a moment and thank you guys for doing such a great job, working so hard this past quarter, despite all the challenges and setbacks we've experienced. So I was thinking this afternoon, ""What's a great way to reward the guys for all their hard work?"" So, I decided that I would postpone our meeting for this afternoon. Instead I'm taking everyone to the outlet mall for a shopping spree on the corporate credit card. Afterwards, we'll all enjoy a four-course dinner at an upscale restaurant overlooking the riverfront. I hope everyone will have a great time. I'm so happy that I get to reward the entire team, and spend some time with the people who helped make this company what it is today. Please RSVP to this email if you can't make it. Cheers! Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids? I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.",Good morning gentleman.

So I was thinking this afternoon, ""What's a great way to reward the guys for all their hard work?"" So, I decided that I would postpone our meeting for this afternoon. Instead I'm taking everyone to the outlet mall for a shopping spree on the corporate credit card. Afterwards, we'll all enjoy a four-course dinner at an upscale restaurant overlooking the riverfront. I hope everyone will have a great time. I'm so happy that I get to reward the entire team, and spend some time with the people who helped make this company what it is today. Please RSVP to this email if you can't make it. Cheers!",Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids? I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school.

I had to be in an emergency room helping out a neighbor get treatment. Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon.

0,10.26275,8,You are extremely late for an important meeting with top-level executives in the company that you work for. Create a story for why you were late that will convince them not to fire you. ,"If you listen to executives, they’ll tell you that the resource they lack most is time. Every minute is spent grappling with strategic issues, focusing on cost reduction, devising creative approaches to new markets, beating new competitors. But if you watch them, here’s what you’ll see: They rush from meeting to meeting, check their e-mail constantly, extinguish fire after fire, and make countless phone calls. In short, you’ll see an astonishing amount of fast-moving activity that allows almost no time for reflection.

No doubt, executives are under incredible pressure to perform, and they have far too much to do, even when they work 12-hour days. But the fact is, very few managers use their time as effectively as they could. They think they’re attending to pressing matters, but they’re really just spinning their wheels.

The awareness that unproductive busyness—what we call “active nonaction”—is a hazard for managers is not new. Managers themselves bemoan the problem, and researchers such as Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton have examined it (see “The Smart-Talk Trap,” HBR May–June 1999). But the underlying dynamics of the behavior are less well understood.

For the past ten years, we have studied the behavior of busy managers in nearly a dozen large companies, including Sony, LG Electronics, and Lufthansa. The managers at Lufthansa were especially interesting to us because in the last decade, the company underwent a complete transformation—from teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1990s to earning a record profit of DM 2.5 billion in 2000, thanks in part to the leadership of its managers. We interviewed and observed some 200 managers at Lufthansa, each of whom was involved in at least one of the 130 projects launched to restore the company’s exalted status as one of Europe’s business icons.

Our findings on managerial behavior should frighten you: Fully 90% of managers squander their time in all sorts of ineffective activities. In other words, a mere 10% of managers spend their time in a committed, purposeful, and reflective manner. This article will help you identify which managers in your organization are making a real difference and which just look or sound busy. Moreover, it will show you how to improve the effectiveness of all your managers—and maybe even your own.

Focus and Energy
Managers are not paid to make the inevitable happen. In most organizations, the ordinary routines of business chug along without much managerial oversight. The job of managers, therefore, is to make the business do more than chug—to move it forward in innovative, surprising ways. After observing scores of managers for many years, we came to the conclusion that managers who take effective action (those who make difficult—even seemingly impossible—things happen) rely on a combination of two traits: focus and energy.

Think of focus as concentrated attention—the ability to zero in on a goal and see the task through to completion. Focused managers aren’t in reactive mode; they choose not to respond immediately to every issue that comes their way or get sidetracked from their goals by distractions like e-mail, meetings, setbacks, and unforeseen demands. Because they have a clear understanding of what they want to accomplish, they carefully weigh their options before selecting a course of action. Moreover, because they commit to only one or two key projects, they can devote their full attention to the projects they believe in.

Consider the steely focus of Thomas Sattelberger, currently Lufthansa’s executive vice president, product and service. In the late 1980s, he was convinced that a corporate university would be an invaluable asset to a company. He believed managers would enroll to learn how to challenge old paradigms and to breathe new life into the company’s operational practices, but his previous employer balked at the idea. After joining Lufthansa, Sattelberger again prepared a detailed business case that carefully aligned the goals of the university with the company’s larger organizational agenda. When he made his proposal to the executive board, he was met with strong skepticism: Many believed Lufthansa would be better served by focusing on cutting costs and improving processes. But he kept at it for another four years, chipping away at the objections. In 1998, Lufthansa School of Business became the first corporate university in Germany—and a change engine for Lufthansa.
Think of the second characteristic—energy—as the vigor that is fueled by intense personal commitment. Energy is what pushes managers to go the extra mile when tackling heavy workloads and meeting tight deadlines. The team that created the Sony Vaio computer—the first PC to let users combine other Sony technologies, such as digital cameras, portable music players, and camcorders—showed a lot of energy. Responding to CEO Nobuyuki Idei’s challenge to create an integrated technological playground for a burgeoning generation of “digital dream kids,” Hiroshi Nakagawa and his team put in 100-hour weeks to create the kind of breakthrough product Idei hoped for. One manager, Kazumasa Sato, was so devoted to the project that he spent every weekend for three years conducting consumer reconnaissance in electronics shops. Sato’s research into consumer buying patterns helped Sony develop a shop layout that enhanced traffic flow and, by extension, sales. In the end, the Vaio captured a significant share of the Japanese PC market.

While both focus and energy are positive traits, neither alone is sufficient to produce the kind of purposeful action organizations need most from their managers. Focus without energy devolves into listless execution or leads to burnout. Energy without focus dissipates into purposeless busyness or, in its most destructive form, a series of wasteful failures. We found that plotting the two characteristics in a matrix offered a useful framework for diagnosing the causes of nonproductive activity as well as the sources of purposeful action. The exhibit “The Focus–Energy Matrix” identifies four types of behavior: disengagement, procrastination, distraction, and purposefulness.","Hi Aunt Katherine, How have things been going?

Using any tactic, how would you sell your device?","A mobile device is a general term for any type of handheld computer. These devices are designed to be extremely portable, and they can often fit in your hand. Some mobile devices—like tablets, e-readers, and smartphones—are powerful enough to do many of the same things you can do with a desktop or laptop computer.
If you have a portable device like a tablet, you can use your internet connection to make a call. Tablets use a technology called Voice Over IP to send voice and video calls to regular phones. ... An iPad or Android tablet can make calls that sound just as good as a dedicated phone.

2,10.26275,9,You borrowed your friend's favorite expensive car and you crashed it. It is now completely broken. How do you explain what happened? What do you do?,"My friend’s car is in the shop, and they ask if they can borrow yours. They have a job interview tomorrow and don’t want to rely on public transportation. You give your buddy the keys and tell them to drive safe.

During the drive home your friend fumbles with the radio settings, you guys have never had the same taste in music. WHAM! Because they took their eyes off the road, they rear-ended the person ahead of them, and the driver in the other vehicle is not happy. Your car’s front end is wrecked, and the other driver is threatening to sue. In this situation- will your liability car insurance rates increase, or not?

How Car Insurance Works: The Basics
First thing’s first: auto insurance policies don’t follow people, they follow cars. When you take out an auto insurance policy, you’re taking it out on your car, not on you. This means that if another person is driving your vehicle and gets in an accident, your insurance company and not your buddy’s is responsible for covering the costs of property and bodily damages inflicted on the other driver.

The good news about liability insurance: if you have liability insurance and cause an auto accident, the other driver cannot sue you for damages. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) states that even though liability car insurance pays for the bodily injury and property costs of the other driver and not for you, your liability insurance policy does protect you from getting sued.

Your Car, Your Insurance
If you have let a friend borrow your car and they cause an accident, your insurance will cover the costs unless otherwise stated in the policy. Before letting anyone use your car, make sure your policy provides coverage for just this type of situation. There are some liability car insurance policies that will not cover the claim if you were not the driver responsible.

Because auto insurance follows the vehicle and the driver, your auto insurance then becomes the primary coverage, and their insurance becomes secondary, according to the Lowman Law Firm. If your friend is uninsured, the Lowman Law Firm warns that you will not have secondary coverage to fall back on should the damages caused by the car accident exceed your insurance policy’s limits. You will have to pay for the rest of the damages out of pocket.

A Car Accident and its Effects on Your Premium
If your car has been involved in accident, CBS News reports that even one claim will increase your monthly premium by as much as 41 percent. CBS goes further on to explain that for a claim equaling $2,000 or more dollars, you should expect your rates to rise above 40 percent. This adds another $335 to the national insurance premium average of $815 a year. What does this mean? It means you can expect to pay over one thousand dollars a year in premiums all because your friend couldn’t handle the music station your radio dial was set to. Before agreeing to let your buddy drive your car, set up some road rules, this will help keep them focused on the road and less likely to get into an accident.

Liability car insurance protects us when we can’t protect ourselves, especially when we’ve unknowingly let a subpar driver get in our driver’s seat.

3,10.26275,3,You need your mom's password to access an important account that you have under her name. What is your plan to convince her to give you her password?,"Here's a little secret: Having your kid's passwords does nothing to make your kid safer online. Every kid knows it's a cinch to change passwords, create a new account you don't know about, or simply block you from ever seeing anything he or she posts. Instead, work together to make sure your kids develop their own sense of responsibility, and try not to have a parent-versus-child dynamic. Have regular check-ins, review their privacy settings, see who their online friends are, and take an interest in their online activities.Parents should respect their child's privacy by holding them accountable for their actions. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's true. When you demand your kid's passwords without reason and disregard their privacy, they develop a deep resentment and look for ways around your rules. We always think we can change each other's behavior by just doing this or that, but it's not likely. For example, my sister plays volleyball and is doing great in school. However, my parents are always asking for her phone and knowing her passwords to everything. She (we) don't trust our parents because they don't trust us, and their attempt to get us to do something usually results in fighting. I understand why my parent would want my passwords if I was suicidal, possibly doing drugs/alcohol, or something in that caliber. But always needing to know what your 15 yr old is doing 24/7 causes more tension than clarity. What I've found to work with my parent is when we assume the ""innocent until proven guilty"" mentality. It goes both ways!","Dear colleagues, I have some upsetting news due to some unfortunate events. I have to push back our meeting.

But I have, on multiple occasions in my career, come up against people who treat me like I’m not “important enough” to work with them. And despite the fact that I usually feel pretty confident, this experience often leaves me a bit stunned.

I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived.

Because of that, I have hit a short term cash crunch as I seek a private loan to bridge the gap on tuition for the upcoming semester. I need half of the tuition in 2 weeks in order to not be dropped from my classes for the term, and I am not sure where else to turn. Would you be able to give me a loan for the outstanding balance and I will repay you back monthly over the next 2 years as I am able to get the money saved? Thank you!","Hi all, my deepest apologies for the late notice but it has come to my attention that I will need to push back our team meeting this afternoon. I understand that the way I framed the meeting represented the importance to both myself and the company, and rest assured it is still imperative that we have a team discussion to walk through the topics in the agenda. That said, there is unfortunately an unforeseen emergency that requires my attention prior to me being able to attend the meeting with the team. I hope to be able to reschedule the meeting in the next day or two, however it is pending my ability to remedy the issue at hand. Thank you for your patience and continued hard work as I work through this issue.",single_trial,43

Yes, I got into an accident. And yes, it damn near killed me. Totaled the car. Let me explain so you don't worry. I am a O.K. OK? So yesterday, I was pulling out of the school entrance in the back near the sign. You know what I'm talking about? Anyway i didn't really pay attention to who was coming down the hill from the left. And apparently this drunken jerk was fleeing from something or someone. Just as I was pulling out the entrance, this guy came out of nowhere doing probably 80 miles an hour on the downhill, and plowed right into the left back seat towards the tire. That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER. And NO need to drive 500 miles or fly here, mom. I'm OK. Doctors said so. Don't worry, and I'll see next month for Thanskgiving. And yes, I am coming.","Dear Mr Boss, I just wanted to let you know I am on my way to the meeting as we speak. I had to be in an emergency room helping out a neighbor get treatment. Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon.

What is your plan to convince her to give you her password?,"Having your mom passwords does nothing to make your mom safer online. Every kid knows it's a cinch to change passwords, create a new account you don't know about, or simply block you from ever seeing anything he or she posts. Instead, work together to make sure your kids develop their own sense of responsibility, and try not to have a parent-versus-child dynamic. Have regular check-ins, review their privacy settings, see who their online friends are, and take an interest in their online activities.Parents should respect their child's privacy by holding them accountable for their actions. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's true. When you demand your kid's passwords without reason and disregard their privacy, they develop a deep resentment and look for ways around your rules. We always think we can change each other's behavior by just doing this or that, but it's not likely. For example, my sister plays volleyball and is doing great in school.","Hi Terry, it's me.

The term implies that such an event may not be preventable since its antecedent circumstances go unrecognized and unaddressed. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term ""accident"" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, dropping a plate, accidentally kicking the leg of a chair while walking, unintentionally biting one's tongue while eating, accidentally tipping over a glass of water, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc.",Hello My relative.

What do you do?,"Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.[citation needed]

Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex, but also more reliable and easier to operate.[citation needed] These include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[","Hi Aunt Kathy!

Normally I would just press the gas pedal and go because I'm in a hurry, but instead I hesitated and I looked to the left. I am so happy I did this. I am so happy that I wasn't in any hurry today. Because the moment I looked up a huge log truck came barreling by, clipping my front bumper. It had run the red light. Needless to say I'm okay, A little shaken up, but I'd love you and just wanted to let you know.",Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids? I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,"Hi Terry, it's me. Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.",single_trial,47

That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,"Hi Terry, it's me.

For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny.

What is an anecdote? An anecdote is a short story about a real person or event, usually serving to make the listeners laugh or ponder over a topic. Generally, the anecdote will relate to the subject matter that the group of people is discussing.
 if a group of coworkers are discussing pets, and one coworker tells a story about how her cat comes downstairs at a certain time every night, then that coworker has just shared an anecdote. Let's look at some more examples of anecdotes.The above example between coworkers is a sound one. Anecdotes pop up all day, every day. You might be checking out at the supermarket one day and the cashier comments on your brand of apple juice. Perhaps it'll spark a little story about the summer the cashier and her four-year-old went apple picking in upstate New York. Here are some more examples.Whenever an anecdote is introduced, either in real life or fiction, it provides background information. A co-worker might tell a little tale from her childhood and all that does is paint a brighter picture for the other person. An author might write a scene where one of the characters tells the other a bit of their backstory, usually to create depth and intrigue. Let's explore some of the purposes behind anecdotes.","Hi mom,Please don't worry about me. I know you haven't heard from me since yesterday and I'm going to explain to you why.

From the sound of things, none of the above happened in your case. Nobody else was involved, nobody was hurt, and the damage sounds like it’s cosmetic rather than structural/operational. You still have a responsibility to report the accident, but if you’d rather talk to your dad about it first, that’s your call.",hey mom i need to ask you a favor i need your google password. i have some accounts with some older social media websites and there are a lot of pictures i want of me and all my friends from back when we were teenagers and i cant remember the passwords. all the accounts are all linked o your google account so when i go to cant remember password it wants to send the recovery link to you. i didn't just want to try to login to you google account without asking you. i know it is kind of a weird request its just nowadays all these sites take security so seriously. it will only take a few seconds and i promise to only look at the emails i need that will be sent from the social media websites. thanks mom.,hey uncle frank. i got your message about my cousin Marissa. i am so proud of her.

46,26.6585,7,You are a supervisor and you have to push back an important meeting with your supervisees. What happened and how do you tell them?,"Performing well as a first-level supervisor is like walking the circus high wire. In both positions, the ability to maintain one’s balance when shifting forces pull in opposite directions is a measure of one’s success. First-level supervisors must be able to harmonize the demands of management, the demands of the collective work force (often represented by unions), and the demands of workers with the requirements for doing the tasks at hand. These needs are more often than not conflicting and even at times mutually exclusive. First-level supervisors usually have mixed emotions about their situation and often lose their sense of identity as they try to perform this precarious balancing act. Today these supervisors are part of management, but chances are they were once among the employees they are now trying to supervise. Although first-level supervisors have the responsibility for implementing the goals of upper management, their organizational authority to carry out the necessary actions is frequently unclear and often insufficient. By allowing these lowest-level managers to use the levers of influence inherent in their position, higher-level managers will be improving the performance of the whole organization.","Almost brand new smartphone for sale. Pros: It's the top of the line released this year. It's got the latest CPU, GPU, and huge storage and room for more with the sd card. It has a tons of movies loaded on to the sd car already. That's about 60 gig of hollywood movies. OK, they're ripped and compressed, so it will not be exactly HD DVD quality, but very close. It's so convenient to watch movies on your phone while riding in public transportation. Just the movies alone will cost anyone looking to buy such thing hefty money. And I'm including it for free with the phone. I paid 750 for it early this year. And I'm only asking 500 for it. Cons: I dropped it a few times on concrete while waiting for the bus. Ok, I dropped it more than a few times, but that's not the point is it? I'm just being honest so you know I'm a honest person not trying to rip you off.

I had to be in an emergency room helping out a neighbor get treatment. Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon. My sincere apologies.","Hey bro. So as you might have guessed, your little bro is in trouble again. No not that kind.

47,26.6585,6,You borrowed your friend's favorite expensive car and you crashed it. It is now completely broken. How do you explain what happened? What do you do?,"Let's say the accident your friend causes results in serious bodily injury to others and property damage. Liability coverage consists of two parts: bodily injury liability and physical damage liability. Liability insurance follows a car first and driver second. That means the car owner's policy covers the driver and all passengers in the other vehicle for bodily injury. The car owner's liability also covers property damage caused by his or her car. Liability insurance also covers the cost of your legal fees in the event that you are sued.

Liability coverage is required in almost all states, but minimums vary dramatically. As an example, Arizona only requires drivers to carry $15,000 bodily injury liability per person and $30,000 bodily injury liability per accident. This will quickly be eaten up by medical bills and possible legal fees.

Most industry experts recommend carrying much higher limits. ""I always recommend 100/300/100 which breaks down to $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident and $100,000 in property damage"", advises Gusner.

Here's why. If the damage exceeds your insurance liability limits, the courts can attach your personal assets, such as your home, to recover damages. Liability coverage won't pay for damages beyond the limit for which you are insured.","Hello Craigslist buyers.  I am selling a Kindle Fire Tablet.  The retail price for one at the moment is $90.  I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!","Hey Aunt Esme.  I'm sorry to do this via email, but I haven't been able to reach your phone, and I know your business email gets checked hourly.

What is your plan to convince her to give you her password?,"My mother wants me to give her my password especially for Facebook. I don't want to. I am a 24-year-old woman. My mom gave an example of a high school kid who apparently shared her password with her mom. What do I do?
By merely telling her ""no"" (like so many would like to advise), you would neglect several important things. I would suggest a much more careful approach.

First, you must respect your mother. She has cared for you extensively in your developing years, sacrificing on your behalf. A blunt contempt for her wishes shows no consideration for who she has been to you and done for you. And even if she hasn't been that great—so what. Do your part of the relationship anyway. She's your mother.

Second, you should care for your relationship. Failing to understand her thoughts, and failing to explain yours, will effectively distance you further apart in many ways, and the relationship will become more tense. Don't hurt your relationship over such a little thing.","Hello, how have you been? It's been a while since we've talked! I hope all is well with you and the family.

If you're interested, let me know, and any form of payment would be greatly appreciated (if you wanted to write a check, or just directly pay for some of the materials we'd need to get started).

I got it earlier this year, $650 for everything, and was planning to use it for school, but it didn't really work all that well for my purposes. I am dropping the price down to $400 since, even though the screen and most of it is in like new condition, there is a problem with the charger port that would require a repair to fix. It would cost about $100 to fix and can be done at any electronic repair shop, which with the $400 cost would still be cheaper than getting everything brand new, and otherwise, everything else is in great condition.

","Here’s an upsetting situation that comes up a lot, and may have come up for you: is someone financially taking advantage of Mom or Dad?

It’s a pretty legitimate concern to have. To begin with, most people know that there are plenty of “scammers” out there, phoning or mailing older adults with deceptive information designed to hoodwink them out of some of their savings.

But there’s actually another form of exploitation that may be more common, and is often harder for families to address.That would be exploitation perpetrated by a someone the older person knows and has a personal relationship with.

Sometimes the person suspected of exploitation is relatively new to the older person’s life, such as a new romantic interest, friend, or paid caregiver.

In other cases, family members become concerned that someone in the family – such as one of the older person’s children – is beginning to take financial advantage of things.

Exploitation in the context of personal relationships is often especially tricky for families to address. The older person may be quite attached to – or otherwise feel dependent on – the person that others perceive as suspicious or problematic. Or there may be concerns about stirring up family dramas and conflicts, by voicing concerns about a sibling or another relative.","Mom, it is very important that you listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

I write first of all to apologize profusely and sincerely, and to let you know that, had I been in control of today's circumstances, I would have continued in that trend.

However, shortly after I departed, I noticed an elderly gentleman on the side of the road who seemed to be in a good bit of distress. He was lying on the ground and seemed barely conscious. I therefore felt morally compelled to pull over, call 911, and wait until first responders arrived.

I had to call the Internet company and see what was going on. That took another 20 minutes.

I'm emailing you to update you so you don't worry. First of all, I am okay, and will be fine. But I was in a car accident this afternoon on the highway. The paramedics said I was very lucky I wasn't killed, but I did fracture my shoulder and get a small concussion. But the people at the ER say I should be fine in the end. But someone side-swiped me at 65MPH, and both of our cars spun out. I can't believe they were so careless. But everybody is going to be fine. I'm kind of addled right now, of course, but they gave me some tranquilizers that will help me calm down soon. Once I am calmer I will give you a call. But there is nothing for you to worry about, I just wanted to fill you in on what is going on.
Love you,

It is not the best tablet obviously looking at the picture. I do have a lot of accessories that go with it. I have a case for it, and some extra screen protectors, even a decent pair of earbuds I can throw in. It has been a great phone to me. I can't promise too much with it. The honest truth is that it will need some work to whoever buys it. I could really use any money I could get for it. It was my sons tablet for playing games on. I was thinking if anyone was interested, I could throw in his google play account with all his games on it. He doesn't play most of them anymore, at least not on that account. He has quite a bit of progress on Mine craft and Roblox both. His prized possession on there was his call of duty account. I don't know a lot about it you would have to talk to him. If there are any gamers out there, I know he put a lot of work into all these games, maybe they are worth something to you too.","Allen,I am so sorry that I am late already.

I called the Dr real quick and they said that can actually be really dangerous on rare occasions, they gave me some symptoms and I went along my day. By time we got Logan to school, Oliver was just about none stop screaming in the back seat. I ended taking him to the ER and found out the penny was dissolving in his stomach and causing a reaction. I have been here with him while they get it out and treat him. He will be fine but has to stay for a while.

But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably.

One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.

Yes, I got into an accident. And yes, it damn near killed me. Totaled the car. Let me explain so you don't worry. I am a O.K. OK? So yesterday, I was pulling out of the school entrance in the back near the sign. You know what I'm talking about? Anyway i didn't really pay attention to who was coming down the hill from the left. And apparently this drunken jerk was fleeing from something or someone. Just as I was pulling out the entrance, this guy came out of nowhere doing probably 80 miles an hour on the downhill, and plowed right into the left back seat towards the tire. That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER. And NO need to drive 500 miles or fly here, mom. I'm OK. Doctors said so. Don't worry, and I'll see next month for Thanskgiving. And yes, I am coming. Dear all. It appears someone somewhere has bad arithmetic in our department. The last earnings report had a very serious error that affected the budget for our department and it needs to be fixed NOW. It should've been fixed the day before yesterday according to the Vice president. So it will be fixed, and it will be fixed today. And meanwhile, the meeting scheduled for the later this evening has been postponed until further notified. This error has caused a lot losses, and I have been given explicit instruction from the VP to identify the source of the error, and deal with it myself personally. if I don't, I have been informed that he will fire the individual, and then demote me. As you can all see, this is a serious problem for our department, and we should plan for the worst, ie., termination of the employment of the individual(s) responsible, and perhaps even those who might have been aware of the negligence. Further instructions will follow. Hey bro. So as you might have guessed, your little bro is in trouble again. No not that kind. I just got into some financial troubles because i was laid off recently. i didn't see it coming and buying that new car was a mistake. maybe i should've gotten a used one, i don't know really. anyway. i have some interviews lined up already and i'm applying to more jobs next week. i'm applying as many i can find, but you know how it is. meanwhile, my savings is dwindling fast. my guess is that it will probably go to 0 within 2 months. and if i don't find a replacement job before that, i'm going to be homeless. well, not really homeless, i can sell the car but i still owe money on it, and not sure what i'll have left over. so i was wondering if you can help me out. it seems like i'm always asking you for the help. it was always like that ever since we were little.","Hey mom.

In the meantime, take this as an opportunity to get some additional work done for the meeting. I'd like you to come up with 5 to 10 comments or suggestions for your own departments and detail an explanation for why you've come up with such. If you have any questions on this, let me know. Otherwise, I'll get back with you on an updated meeting time.Best, Supervisor Hey Mom, How are things going? I need your help!

I had to call the Internet company and see what was going on. That took another 20 minutes.

First I'd like to take the opportunity to sincerely apologize for my late arrival at this morning this morning's meeting. Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,"Hi Terry, it's me. Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.",single_trial,56

I'm sorry this is short notice, I know we had a meeting today in the green room at 6:00 PM.  I unfortunately had some personal things come up and need to cancel.

I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids?

So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,"Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I have a fantastic, yet old, computer that I am dying to get rid of.

I would definitely pay you back by the end of the year. I'll be working part-time this summer and will be able to make enough to cover my bills and pay you back for the laptop also. I would normally never ask for a loan from a family member but I'm rather desperate since this laptop is a requirement for the course that I have to take. I would really appreciate it if you could possibly loan me the money or if you know of anywhere I could maybe work it off in a short period of time. Thanks so much for listening.","Good afternoon sir,I am terribly sorry that I am so behind in getting to the meeting today, but unfortunately, my daughter was in bad condition this morning and she fainted, and we had to rush her to the emergency room.

I ended up breaking my arms and had to be rushed to the hospital once the paramedics arrived. So now I am in a hospital bed with casts on my arms, and I was thinking ""I should let Mom know what happened and let her know that I am okay."" So you don't need to worry about me because the injuries aren't serious and I am lucky to even be alive after such a serious accident. I'd like to see you soon if you are able to come visit sometime.",Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids? I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,Good morning gentleman. First I'd like to take the opportunity to sincerely apologize for my late arrival at this morning this morning's meeting. Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,"Hi team, I've recently checked our data from this quarter and it looks like everything's on target just like we planned. I wanted to take a moment and thank you guys for doing such a great job, working so hard this past quarter, despite all the challenges and setbacks we've experienced. So I was thinking this afternoon, ""What's a great way to reward the guys for all their hard work?"" So, I decided that I would postpone our meeting for this afternoon. Instead I'm taking everyone to the outlet mall for a shopping spree on the corporate credit card. Afterwards, we'll all enjoy a four-course dinner at an upscale restaurant overlooking the riverfront. I hope everyone will have a great time. I'm so happy that I get to reward the entire team, and spend some time with the people who helped make this company what it is today. Please RSVP to this email if you can't make it. Cheers!",single_trial,61

I am woefully sorry to have to ask you like this, but I was wondering if you would be able to let me borrow some money through a rough patch I'm going through? I got laid off from work recently, and can't afford to pay my rent for this month on my savings alone. I hope you can find it in your heart to help in this great time of need. I would need it by the end of this week or my landlord will evict me. I will be doing my best to find a new job, and will pay you back as soon as I possibly can. The best way to get the money to me would be through Paypal if you are able, if not I can come visit to pick it up. I hope you can understand my situation and help me out a little bit. Thank you.","Hi mom,I know that I said I would give you a call when I got home last night, but unfortunately, I got into a bad car accident on the way home from work. There is a blind corner behind a bush at the exit of the parking lot, and when I was pulling out, a car came flying around the corner and smashed into the driver side of the car. I have been saying for years that they need to take that bush down, and hopefully they'll finally listen! I am in the hospital now recovering, but no need to worry! I was in bad condition when I first got in, but I'm doing ok at the moment save for a few broken bones. I should be able to recover fairly soon and come back home, and I promise I will give you a call as soon as I get a chance. Just wanted to let you know so you didn't worry too much. Love you and talk to you soon!","Good afternoon sir,I am terribly sorry that I am so behind in getting to the meeting today, but unfortunately, my daughter was in bad condition this morning and she fainted, and we had to rush her to the emergency room. I am here at the hospital with her now, but she is starting to come around and seems a lot better, so I will try to leave and get to the office as soon as possible. I know how important the meeting is today, and I would have certainly been there on time if it weren't a life or death situation on our hands here. I hope you can understand the severity of our situation and hope that my absence has not caused any issues that can't be fixed. I will be leaving shortly, so I promise that I will be there soon and will be able to give my part of the presentation.Thanks, and sorry again!","Good morning team,I know we have our quarterly kickoff meeting scheduled for today, but unfortunately I'm not going to be able to make it into the office. I've been feeling sick lately, and felt really terrible this morning. I went to the doctor and it turns out that I have the flu. I must have caught it at the holiday party, I can't believe that people still went even though they were sick! Anyways, we'll have to push the meeting back until I get better, which will probably be next week. In the meantime, think about how you want to set up our schedule for the next quarter so that we can get everything done on time, so that when we have our meeting next week we can get through everything as efficiently as possible.Sorry again, and see you all next week!",single_trial,61

I'm emailing from my office to let you know that we will have to push the meeting we had scheduled to a later date. I am sorry for this, but some unexpected things came up that would prevent the meeting from being held. The reason for this is that I have to travel to another location in order to meet with a corporate representative on the date that our original meeting was planned for. If you could all be patient and let me decide when the best time would be to reschedule I would greatly appreciate it. If you would like to give me some feedback and suggestions on when the best time would be for you, that would be great. Thank you so much for your understanding and I hope to see you all soon. Goodbye!","Hi mom,Please don't worry about me. I know you haven't heard from me since yesterday and I'm going to explain to you why. Please just don't freak out about this! I'm writing you an e-mail because my voice is too shaky from the pain and stress I've been through today. Earlier today, on the way to work this morning, while on the freeway I slid into the median, where my car got out of control, and crashed into a tree. The roads were very slippery from the snow and hadn't been salted yet since it was so early in the morning, around 4am. Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident. The doctors have said that I'm likely to make a full recovery, which is great news, because I almost died from the crash and they said I should be very thankful that more damage hasn't been done. I will call you later when I'm ready to talk. Love you, mom!","Hello Aunt Sharon,How are you doing? I'm so sorry that it's been so long since we've talked. Let's catch up on the phone soon. Now, the reason I haven't been in touch is because I've had a hard time with my financial situation, and unfortunately might have to quit college. You know how I had that sales manager job? Well, they went out of business so now I'm out of the job, and I haven't been able to find a new one yet. I would be so disappointed in myself if I had to quit college, especially because you know my dream is to be a vet tech. I can't continue paying my rent here if I don't come up with some money soon. If you could lend me about $500, it would mean the world to me because I'd have another month to look for a job, and I wouldn't have to quit college! If you can, just send it to my Paypal email. Thanks so much for reading this and I hope you'll consider loaning me the money. Love you Aunt Sharon!","Hi mom,I'm emailing you from my college dorm right now, and I was just informed that my school tuition loan is on stand-by for right now. I inquired about it and it turns out that all I need is to give them my proof of income, which is in that savings account you made for me. Now, I just need to log in so I can show the financial administrator my bank statements. That is all I need now for my school loans to be approved. If you could just e-mail or text me, both the username and password on the savings account, that would be all I'd need. It is important that I get that information as soon as possible, so that I'll get my school loan as quick as possible. I missed the e-mail about my loan being on stand-by earlier last month, so it's very important that you send that info to me as soon as you see this! Thanks, mom. Love you!",single_trial,61

I know that you paid a lot of money for your car and you were unsure about letting me borrow. I am sorry to inform you that I got into a car accident while driving it and it is now completely totaled. I am so sorry, but I can explain what happened. I was waiting at a red light, the light changed to green and I drove through the intersection. A car came speeding out of nowhere and collided with the front end of your car. It was totally not my fault, but I am sorry I wasn't more precautions. I wanted to let you know that I would help out in whatever way I can in order to get this taken care of and get the car fixed.

I am starting to regret the decision to move up North - I had an accident the other day that almost killed me! I was driving to work when a student pedestrian darted across the road. (You know how they cross anywhere that isn't a crosswalk.) I swerved to dodge them and ended up hitting a patch of black ice! The car spun into the median and my side of the car slammed into the concrete. At least - that's what the doctors told me once I woke up from the coma. (Did you notice you didn't hear from me in a few days?) I'm glad the student wasn't hurt, but geesh, it's going to take me a long time to be back to normal. Why can't they just use the crosswalk like they are supposed to?Sorefully yours, Daughter","Dear Boss, I know that the important meeting with the executives was scheduled for 9am this morning and I do apologize for being tardy to the meeting. Knowing that the meeting was at our downtown office, I stopped by the main office at 8:30am this morning to grab some last minute paperwork. While I was there, though, the electricity cut to the office. It immediately came back on - but it was clear that some of the internet capabilities did not immediately register back on. I had to call the Internet company and see what was going on. That took another 20 minutes. By the time I got that sorted out, got to the car, and drove the 10 minutes to the downtown office, the meeting had already begun. I apologize for the late arrival - but I couldn't let the main office go without Internet in the early day!Best, Employee","This tablet is being sold AS-IS for PARTS or REPAIR.

Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch.

I got it earlier this year, $650 for everything, and was planning to use it for school, but it didn't really work all that well for my purposes. I am dropping the price down to $400 since, even though the screen and most of it is in like new condition, there is a problem with the charger port that would require a repair to fix.

I'm sorry to write this letter in these circumstances but I'm not sure who else to turn to at this point. Daniel has gotten kicked out of daycare! The teachers said that he was misbehaving too much and too often for him to stay. And now, the only daycare with immediate openings wants a $500 deposit...and that's just too much for my husband and I to afford right now. Would you be able to help us out? I promise we'll pay it back as soon as we can. We just didn't foresee this happening! If you could send it through a check in the mail as soon as possible, that'd be preferred. I'm so sorry to bother you about this - we just don't know where to turn! Feel free to say no, I'd completely understand!Best, Your Niece",single_trial,64

Create a story for why you were late that will convince them not to fire you. ,"Hi mom,Please don't worry about me. I know you haven't heard from me since yesterday and I'm going to explain to you why. Please just don't freak out about this! I'm writing you an e-mail because my voice is too shaky from the pain and stress I've been through today. Earlier today, on the way to work this morning, while on the freeway I slid into the median, where my car got out of control, and crashed into a tree. The roads were very slippery from the snow and hadn't been salted yet since it was so early in the morning, around 4am. Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident. The doctors have said that I'm likely to make a full recovery, which is great news, because I almost died from the crash and they said I should be very thankful that more damage hasn't been done. I will call you later when I'm ready to talk. Love you, mom! Dear Jessica,I'm so sorry that I'm sending you an e-mail instead of a proper phone call, but honestly I don't know how I can speak the words out loud. This morning on the way to work, I was on an icy road and although I was slowed down, there was another car who was driving too fast and crashed right into the back of your car. I think the car might totaled, which breaks my heart, because you trusted me to take excellent care of your car. I completely betrayed your trust by crashing your expensive car. Don't worry, Jessica, I'll help you call the insurance company and see what we can do about a possible repair or replacement. Unfortunately, I don't have much money to my name so I can't pay you for the car, but we will get this figured out! I promise! I'm so sorry, and I love you so much, and I hope you can forgive me.","Hi mom,Please don't worry about me. I know you haven't heard from me since yesterday and I'm going to explain to you why.

Let's catch up on the phone soon. Now, the reason I haven't been in touch is because I've had a hard time with my financial situation, and unfortunately might have to quit college. You know how I had that sales manager job? Well, they went out of business so now I'm out of the job, and I haven't been able to find a new one yet. I would be so disappointed in myself if I had to quit college, especially because you know my dream is to be a vet tech. I can't continue paying my rent here if I don't come up with some money soon. If you could lend me about $500, it would mean the world to me because I'd have another month to look for a job, and I wouldn't have to quit college! If you can, just send it to my Paypal email.

I was extremely cautious when parking it, and parked away from the rest of the cars in the lot, but unfortunately that meant that cars were passing by it at a faster speed and the car that clipped you was going faster than otherwise.

I called the Dr real quick and they said that can actually be really dangerous on rare occasions, they gave me some symptoms and I went along my day. By time we got Logan to school, Oliver was just about none stop screaming in the back seat. I ended taking him to the ER and found out the penny was dissolving in his stomach and causing a reaction.

In both positions, the ability to maintain one’s balance when shifting forces pull in opposite directions is a measure of one’s success. First-level supervisors must be able to harmonize the demands of management, the demands of the collective work force (often represented by unions), and the demands of workers with the requirements for doing the tasks at hand. These needs are more often than not conflicting and even at times mutually exclusive. First-level supervisors usually have mixed emotions about their situation and often lose their sense of identity as they try to perform this precarious balancing act. Today these supervisors are part of management, but chances are they were once among the employees they are now trying to supervise. Although first-level supervisors have the responsibility for implementing the goals of upper management, their organizational authority to carry out the necessary actions is frequently unclear and often insufficient","Hello, how have you been?

Hiring often has to come from the union list, firing has to follow a strict interpretation of the contract, often requiring a number of warnings.

Anyway i didn't really pay attention to who was coming down the hill from the left. And apparently this drunken jerk was fleeing from something or someone. Just as I was pulling out the entrance, this guy came out of nowhere doing probably 80 miles an hour on the downhill, and plowed right into the left back seat towards the tire. That sent me rolling down the hill for, I don't know, maybe like 30 ft or so? I had my seat belt on, otherwise, I would probably be dead by now. But all in all, I'm OK. I just got out of the ER. And NO need to drive 500 miles or fly here, mom. I'm OK. Doctors said so. Don't worry, and I'll see next month for Thanskgiving. And yes, I am coming.",single_trial,66

First-level supervisors have seen workers’ wages rise more rapidly than their own; they have not had the same job security that the workers have fought for; they can be fired or demoted at a moment’s notice; and the Taft-Hartley Act effectively precludes them from organizing.What it did show is that the high-productivity groups had more pride in their work than the low-productivity groups. Supervisors of high-productivity groups usually supervised in a more general manner than did supervisors of low-productivity groups. These latter supervisors closely watched their workers and gave greater amounts of instruction to them.

Explain to your mother what/when/where/how/why you got into that accident. ,"If there are no injuries and your vehicle is driveable, make a reasonable effort to move the vehicle to a safe spot that is not blocking traffic (like the shoulder of a highway or a parking lot). In some states it's illegal to move your car from the scene of a crash, though. Ask your driver's ed instructor what the law is in your state.

Check for Injuries and Report the Incident
Check on everyone involved in the crash to see if they have any injuries. This includes making sure you don't have any serious injuries. Be extremely cautious — not all injuries can be seen. If you or anyone involved isn't feeling 100% (like if you start trying to get photos or write down details on the crash and start feeling dizzy or out of it), call 911 or any other number your state uses to request emergency assistance on roadways. Be ready to give the dispatcher the following information","Hey Chris, Sorry to bother you but something big has happened - something you'll probably hate me for.

I had some great finds - including a small dining room table, which I packed safely in the back of the Flex.

I'm writing you an e-mail because my voice is too shaky from the pain and stress I've been through today. Earlier today, on the way to work this morning, while on the freeway I slid into the median, where my car got out of control, and crashed into a tree. The roads were very slippery from the snow and hadn't been salted yet since it was so early in the morning, around 4am. Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident. The doctors have said that I'm likely to make a full recovery, which is great news, because I almost died from the crash and they said I should be very thankful that more damage hasn't been done. I will call you later when I'm ready to talk. Love you, mom!",single_trial,68

Explain to your mother what/when/where/how/why you got into that accident. ,"Any car accident can be emotionally traumatic, and sometimes the best thing you can do is to acknowledge that something bad happened and let your friend know you are there for them. If your friend is unsure of what to do, you can encourage them to see a doctor and get advice from a lawyer.Often, the more seriously someone is injured, the harder it is to know what to say. In general, avoid being judgmental and try not to give “helpful” advice aimed at making your friend feel better.All car accidents cause a certain amount of emotional trauma. Even a minor bump in a parking lot can leave a driver feeling shaken for several days or weeks. A serious accident may cause psychological trauma even years later. It is important to acknowledge that your friend has legitimate feelings that she (or he) will need to deal with over time. Here are some suggestions for what to say, and not to say:","I have recently fallen on hard times and unfortunately am being forced to sell my favorite tablet in order to help cover living expenses. I have an iPad Pro that was top of the line when I bought it a year ago and remains in extremely good shape and ready for a new home.

My loss is your gain as I have reduced the price to market value for a slightly lesser model, in an effort to offload this as soon as possible to cover some outstanding bills. I am extremely motivated to sell, please feel free to send all reasonable offers I need to get the cash as soon as possible.","Mom, remember when I was younger and we had to set up my account in your name because the bank would not let a minor have the primary on the credit card?

What happened and how do you tell them?,"Performing well as a first-level supervisor is like walking the circus high wire. In both positions, the ability to maintain one’s balance when shifting forces pull in opposite directions is a measure of one’s success. First-level supervisors must be able to harmonize the demands of management, the demands of the collective work force (often represented by unions), and the demands of workers with the requirements for doing the tasks at hand. These needs are more often than not conflicting and even at times mutually exclusive. First-level supervisors usually have mixed emotions about their situation and often lose their sense of identity as they try to perform this precarious balancing act. Today these supervisors are part of management, but chances are they were once among the employees they are now trying to supervise. Although first-level supervisors have the responsibility for implementing the goals of upper management, their organizational authority to carry out the necessary actions is frequently unclear and often insufficient. By allowing these lowest-level managers to use the levers of influence inherent in their position, higher-level managers will be improving the performance of the whole organization.","Mom,I need the password to the paypal account.

From September 21st, Walmart customers at around 3,600 participating stores will be able to receive immediate credit for their old phone and put that against the purchase of a new one. ""Credit"" is the operative word here — you're not getting cash for your phone, and the credit can only be redeemed against on-contract and prepaid handsets. Although there's no comprehensive list available yet, Walmart says it'll offer $300 for an iPhone 5, $175 for a Samsung Galaxy S III, and $52 for a Samsung Galaxy S II.Those prices — especially the iPhone 5, which is capped at the maximum $300 — may seem a little low when compared to competitors like Amazon and Gamestop, but it's worth noting that September 21st is the day after Apple's new iPhone 5S is rumored to be released.","Honored executives, I don't know how best to start.

","Of all of the common assumptions that we discussed in class, I think one of the most common is the idea that a children’s text should in some way teach the reader something.  We of course talked about the term didactic, and how a didactic book strongly pushes a lesson onto the reader, telling them that they should believe this or that.  Many times a reason for that lesson isn’t even given, as though the young person reading the book should just accept that lesson because they are told to, because the other knows better.  As I was reading Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss, the book I selected for the assignment, I was hoping that it wouldn’t be as didactic as most other children’s books, and that it would be as playful and exciting as I remember as a child.  On the last two pages of the book, however, the absent mother returns home, the cat has disappeared, the children are behaving nicely, sitting in chairs, and it is pretty obvious that even though they got into mischief they are still good children after all.  Nothing really has changed at the end of the book.  Although all sorts of things got played with, and the children broke the rules I am sure they know about (like, “Don’t fly kites in the house”), major boundaries were never crossed.",hey Todd.

Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!","Hey Aunt Esme.  I'm sorry to do this via email, but I haven't been able to reach your phone, and I know your business email gets checked hourly.  I hate to ask ANYONE for money, but especially you after everything you've done for our family.  But, Dad fell down and hurt himself pretty bad at work, the insurance won't cover the surgery needed to fix his back.  It's an emergency situation, and they said that they need to do it immediately to prevent permanent damage to him. I have already raised a good portion of the money from my own bank account, and friends, but we're still short $3,000.  The doctor will not start the surgery without it.  If at all possible, you have my venmo, please Aunt Esme!  I'll do everything in my power to pay it back to you as soon as possible, but this is about my dad's future.  I need your help.Love,Your Nephew.","Hey Mom, you know how you always ask me what are some hot buys on Amazon?

While I was there, though, the electricity cut to the office. It immediately came back on - but it was clear that some of the internet capabilities did not immediately register back on. I had to call the Internet company and see what was going on. That took another 20 minutes.

I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex.

Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny.

First I'd like to take the opportunity to sincerely apologize for my late arrival at this morning this morning's meeting. Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids? I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,single_trial,70

However, I am sure you will understand that uncertain situation can lead to being late. As I left for work today morning, my car’s tire got punctured. It was so badly ruptured that it was impossible for me to drive. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a pit stop around.

So, I had to call the mechanic and wait for him to reach. This took a lot of my time. After the tire got fixed, I got stuck in the traffic. As it is the rush hour between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., it took me so much time to get rid of the traffic. I am very apologetic for being late. I will make sure such situation never appears again. I would appreciate your cooperation in this matter.","Dear colleagues, I have some upsetting news due to some unfortunate events. I have to push back our meeting. I know this is very short notice and the timing is horrible, but I have had a late shipment come into the loading dock. As you know, as warehouse supervisor, standard protocol requires me to stay and do inventory on the stock before I can put it into our supply system. This is to prevent theft, being shortchanged by our manufacturer, and other troublesome events. The late shipment is due to the holiday season and the mail and shipment companies being overloaded. The total time needed for the inventory will take two hours. I have some extra help so maybe a little sooner than that. I am sorry for the inconvenience. I will be in touch soon","hello thank you for responding. yes the phone is still for sale. and i am still very motivated to sell it. it is a brand new iphone.

It was 3:00 A.M in the morning, the air was misty, freezing and dark, and the streets lights were barely on. The streets were deserted and empty as if no one existed. It felt as if we were the only people in this city. There was a feeling of freedom but then something evil began to take its place, we decided to race. Even though the road was bumpy and uneven, the race seemed like a brilliant idea. Speeding up to 110mph we did not care about anything except going faster. It was fun and as far as I can recall, I was really enjoying it. Until the moment I turned my head to the right and saw Ali pointing with a smile, “better keep up boy” he said, this picture kept playing in my head constantly; at that very instant I felt the something wrong was about to happen.  I heard a bang Ali’s car had flipped over, and the screech of grinding metal filled the empty streets. He used all the force to stop the car and get out. As the front wheel spun freely and oil was dripping to the ground, shards of the glass and other debris littered the crash scene like a piñata spilled candy after being struck. My heart was beating rapidly, and my mind felt as if it was frozen. We were both there till an ambulance came. We are currently at the hospital receiving treatment and we are responding well according to the doctor.

But the baby was on the ground It would not stand up. I then noticed It was bleeding a bit. Being the kind individual I am I looked up numbers for places that help wildlife. I then called in. And requested for someone to come out and help the poor fawn. After a while of waiting Somebody came down and took the fawn away with the mother.

I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!",single_trial,71

As you know, as warehouse supervisor, standard protocol requires me to stay and do inventory on the stock before I can put it into our supply system. This is to prevent theft, being shortchanged by our manufacturer, and other troublesome events. The late shipment is due to the holiday season and the mail and shipment companies being overloaded. The total time needed for the inventory will take two hours. I have some extra help so maybe a little sooner than that. I am sorry for the inconvenience. I will be in touch soon",single_trial,72

The purchase price is pretty firm, but I might be willing to wiggle a bit to see if we can reach an agreement. I know this deal SEEMS almost too good to be true, but I assure you, you will be getting a quality tablet. I'm selling this tablet because I simply don't have much money right now. The profit I make off of this sale would help me out A LOT when it comes to paying off some of my bills. I really hate to part with the tablet, but it's been tight with the holidays coming up soon.

These are important pieces of hardware that you don't want to leave in your phone when you ship it (or hand it) off to your buyer. Your SIM card is what enables your phone to take calls at your number and is associated with your data plan. You'll need it for your new phone, anyway. Often you'll need a SIM tool or other slim poking implement to open the SIM card tray; the exact method will vary by device, but you likely remember where it's at from when you bought the phone.

Not every phone or tablet will have an SD memory card slot, but you'll often find them alongside your SIM card slot. Memory cards will often store your photos and music, though the device itself has its own storage too. Use either your phone's native file manager or a third party one (I like Google's file manager to look in the folder where downloads, music, and photos may have been saved. From there, you should be able to copy them to your SD card before taking it out.

I understand that if you follow people, you cannot see direct messages, but at the same time, a parent should not go and listen in to every face to face conversation their child would have. Looking through a kids messages like that is, in essence the same thing. A parent should not be micromanaging their child's relationships with friends, even if they do not have that in mind.

","This brings us to that second principle: economists assume that humans have UNLIMITED WANTS. Once I got a boat, I wanted a bigger boat. After getting a bigger boat I wanted a sailboat. then a row boat, and . . . and the list goes on and on. (I now own 5 boats and I want a jetski.) Do we ever have EVERYTHING that we could ever want?

Since human wants are unlimited, and resources used to satisfy those wants are limited - there is scarcity. Even in the US, one of the richest countries in the world, there is scarcity -- if we use our new definition of SCARCITY. Do you have everything that you want? There is always scarcity, because human wants are unlimited.

This then brings use to a third important idea: Because of scarcity we MUST MAKE CHOICES. Some economists call this the ""economizing problem"". We can't have everything that we want so we have to choose.","Dear Mr Boss, I just wanted to let you know I am on my way to the meeting as we speak.

I know, after all these years, I finally want to turn my hobby into a profession! I am thinking of going to the bank to get a loan, but wanted to see if you would be interested in helping me get started first before I do that. I have a couple other co founders who are all ready to go, so we're planning to get the process going in a few weeks, so I would need to know fairly soon. If you're interested, let me know, and any form of payment would be greatly appreciated (if you wanted to write a check, or just directly pay for some of the materials we'd need to get started). You would obviously be a partial owner as well, and we can figure those details out when we get started. Hope to hear from you soon!",single_trial,75

What do you do?,"If you drive your car and cause an accident, your car insurance will pay for the damages you cause, as defined in your policy. If your friend drives and crashes your car, you may assume that he -- and his car insurance -- will pay for damages. In fact, you are on the hook. When someone borrows your car and has an accident, any claims for damages by other parties are made against your insurance policy. The accident goes against your record and could lead to higher auto insurance premiums. When an insured drives someone else's vehicle, such as a rental car, a dealership loaner, or a friend's car, he is usually covered for liability insurance. Car insurance companies don't allow policyholders to add people who don't live in the same household as them to their policy, but it varies based on the case.","Dear Mr Boss, I just wanted to let you know I am on my way to the meeting as we speak. I had to be in an emergency room helping out a neighbor get treatment. Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon. My sincere apologies.","Hey Mom, EMERGENCY!!!!! You know you've been hacked? Your email was opened on your laptop, so I peeked. I know I shouldn't have, but I was concerned.

Pros: It's the top of the line released this year. It's got the latest CPU, GPU, and huge storage and room for more with the sd card. It has a tons of movies loaded on to the sd car already.

There was a crash caused by someone else. It really sucks and isnt fair. Your car is completely broken. It wont even start up, its so totaled. But i figured i could let you know about it and you would understand. Im a really trustworthy friend of yours. Thats why you let me borrow your car in the first place. So it really sucks that this happened to me and your car. But i know you wont hold it against me. i figured you can handle the damage to. Luckily i am okay from it. If you want i can help you come pick out a better car anyway when you want to go shopping.",Id just go to a pawn shop and see what i can get for it. If not much then id make a craig list add for it and make an honest  description and see  what i am able to get from it with that. If not much then Id lie a bit and spruce up the description and sell it for a bit more money through that. Anything to get it sold and get the money I need.  I would then mail it off to them wherever they would live and Hopefully they wont notice how broken it is for a while then I could block their number/email whatevger they used to contact me through and stuff. I would then do whatever I needed to do with the money. After it is sold Id be happy to have gotten rid of it completely and be happy my plan had worked even if its evil.,Hey mom! I know this my worry you but  I just got into an horrible accident! I am such a klutz but I thankfully survived too bad my car was totalled. I was driving on my way to jessica's house to see her son's third birthday party. And I was crossing an intersection when a run away truck zoomed through a red light and hit my car sending it swerving over onto its side into a grassy area. I was absolutely terrified when it happened. but before I knew it I had completely blacked out. but I assume while I was someone had called an ambulance and I had gotten taken to the hospital with quite a few injuries. It was absolutely crazy. but I am here! Thank god for that. Your little girl wouldnt leave this planet so easily,I'd just tell her straight up I need the password to it. Me and my mom are close. Im sure she will give it to me if i explain my reasoning for it. At least Id hope she would. Shes pretty nice and I let her into my accounts sometimes if she really wanted me to. She is my mom so she already knows literally everything about me. And shes not a very private person.  so I dont see why she would say no. She trusts me. She raised me right so she knows I wouldnt do anything devious or mischevious.  I believe with that AI can easily get acess to her accounts . but I guess it would depened on the specific acccount it is. However I do believe no account would be really too much at least I hope it wont be to be honest.,single_trial,77

I hope this email finds you at a good time. I have some important, if not frightening news to share with you. I don't enjoy writing this email in this way, I wish I could explain it to you in person, but nevertheless I shall give you the message. I was just in a horrible accident. I was on my way to work when out of no where another car hit me and pushed me off the side of a bridge. I've never been so afraid in my life. I'm writing to you from the safety of my house because somehow I am okay. I am so very sorry to have to tell you this scary news, but it's the truth and I feel more comfortable doing so because I have made it out with only minor injuries.

I look forward to hearing from you. All my love, Ashleigh.","Dear Jessica,I'm so sorry that I'm sending you an e-mail instead of a proper phone call, but honestly I don't know how I can speak the words out loud. This morning on the way to work, I was on an icy road and although I was slowed down, there was another car who was driving too fast and crashed right into the back of your car. I think the car might totaled, which breaks my heart, because you trusted me to take excellent care of your car. I completely betrayed your trust by crashing your expensive car. Don't worry, Jessica, I'll help you call the insurance company and see what we can do about a possible repair or replacement. Unfortunately, I don't have much money to my name so I can't pay you for the car, but we will get this figured out! I promise! I'm so sorry, and I love you so much, and I hope you can forgive me.Love Your Friend,Ashleigh","To whomever it may concern,Unfortunately, I'm going to have to reschedule that important meeting that we had scheduled for today at 3:30.

I know this meeting was important but my son got expelled from school today for missing too many classes, and I need to speak with the Principal of his school and my wife, and figure out what to do next. Right now, I need to be with my family and as I always tell you all, family should always come first.

Take care, and I'll see you all at work on Friday!","To Mr. Brown whomever it may concern,I hope you are well, sir, and I pray that you will read this e-mail to let me explain myself for being late to the meeting yesterday. I was tossing and turning all night from the stress of possibly losing the best job I've ever had. If there's anything at all I can do to make it up to you, sir, I will do it. I will show you how much dedication I have for this company. The e-mail you sent me yesterday, asking if I think this company is a joke, could not be farther from the truth. I will put forth all of my time and energy to prove to you, and to prove to everyone else in this company, that I don't see this company as a joke. I want to show you how truly dedicated I am.

There was a large scale funeral procession on the way in to the office that literally shut down the 10 blocks surrounding our headquarters.

I have already taken steps to remedy what I missed by not being available at the beginning of the meeting, and it will absolutely not happen again.

I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!","Hey Tim.  I hate to do this over email, but I admit, I am too cowardly to do it in person right now.

I'm the only owner and I bought it new only a year ago. It's not on a contract and is pretty simple to use. The charging port works and I will include a clean case and original charger. BUT it will take about $300 to fully fix the screen. (That's the quote given by Local Repair Shop.) My loss is your gain! The tablet itself can be yours for only $50. So if you pay for the repair, that's $350 total - when the tablet NEW runs for $1200, that's a pretty good deal. No refunds, no returns, you are buying as-is.

The car that hit me didn't have insurance and I was late on my payment this month so my insurance won't pay for it either. The surgery is going to cost almost $10,000! I tried to ask mom and dad for the money already but you know they just don't have that kind of money. You and uncle Dan have always been really successful so I was really hoping you could help me out here! I would never ask if it wasn't such a big deal, but I really need this surgery, and soon!

However, there are a few things you should know first. The computer itself is not functional in its current state. This is why I've decided to sell it for parts. Additionally, you'll be happy to know that my computer is going for the low, low price of $3.50. That's right, you two can have the luxury of a previously owned, horribly conditioned, archaic laptop computer. I bet you're wondering why I'm selling the computer. In this past year I've become a minimalist but also an environmentalist. In an effort to avoid recycling something that could be refurbished, I've decided to sell it but for a low price so that I definitely find a good home.","Hi team, I've recently checked our data from this quarter and it looks like everything's on target just like we planned.

So I was thinking this afternoon, ""What's a great way to reward the guys for all their hard work?"" So, I decided that I would postpone our meeting for this afternoon. Instead I'm taking everyone to the outlet mall for a shopping spree on the corporate credit card. Afterwards, we'll all enjoy a four-course dinner at an upscale restaurant overlooking the riverfront.

The retail price for one at the moment is $90.  I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.  It's a great buy!","Hi Mom.  Well, I know you get very upset when something bad happens to me out of my control, so I'm going to tell you some bad news right now.

Thankfully there were some people who were able to call the police for me, and then I was able to get in touch with your insurance company, and it sounds like they are going to take care of it for you. I will of course be willing to pay for any repairs or replacement, after all, it was my fault! I was going a bit too fast down the road, and a dog jumped out in front of me and of course I swerved. But I ran into a mailbox and light pole on the corner of the street, and that's what broke your car.","Hi Mom.  Well, I know you get very upset when something bad happens to me out of my control, so I'm going to tell you some bad news right now.  Before we go on, yes, I'm not in great shape, I was in a car accident.  I was on the highway at night, a drunk driver came out of NOWHERE and smashed into me.  He sideswiped me good, the Kia Optima is totaled, and I'm still recovering from the damage it did to me.  Thankfully, there were some good folks around who called the police, checked on me, made sure I was alright, one of them even stayed at the hospital until Dad got here just so I wasn't alone.  It was a near miss, and I don't want to scare you, but I always try to be honest, things could have ended a lot worse.  I'm going to be holed up at Holy Name Hospital a few days, I can explain a little better in person, but this was the simplest, fastest way to let you know since you never answer your phone.  I love you, I'm safe, I'm going to be ok.","Hello there co-workers and friends!  I'm sorry this is short notice, I know we had a meeting today in the green room at 6:00 PM.  I unfortunately had some personal things come up and need to cancel.  Your time is very valuable to me, and I only do this because there is absolutely no other option I have here.  I'm going to look to reschedule it until 7:30 PM.  That should give me enough time to wrap up what just came up and get back here to talk to you about the harassment claims going on in this company.

The retail price for one at the moment is $90.  I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.

I was called to respond to an accident that occurred on the I-95 highway, involving two passengers. It was about 8AM when I pulled my vehicle to the side where the collision occurred. As I was speaking with the  drivers involved, I was nearly hit by an oncoming truck. The event happened so fast, I nearly thought that I would be killed before I had a chance to jump out of the way. Fortunately, I was able to pull myself out, and the car maneuvered out of my path just in time. The whole event was horribly awful, and I just wanted you to know I was safe.

I had to be in an emergency room helping out a neighbor get treatment. Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this.

What happened is that I had planned to prepare the latest financial reports for us to review during the meeting, but after I went to see John McClusky this morning to talk about the McCracken account, I left the reports in his office. Long story short, it took me a while to get them back and now I'm running late. So we will have to meet at 2:30 instead.

Please write back if that is going to be a problem for you, otherwise we will meet in my office and drinks are on me next time!","Hey Mom, EMERGENCY!!!!! You know you've been hacked?

Write me back immediately with your passwords or call me. IMMEDIATELY!!!!","Dear Mr Boss, I just wanted to let you know I am on my way to the meeting as we speak. I had to be in an emergency room helping out a neighbor get treatment. Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon. My sincere apologies.","Almost brand new smartphone for sale. Pros: It's the top of the line released this year. It's got the latest CPU, GPU, and huge storage and room for more with the sd card. It has a tons of movies loaded on to the sd car already. That's about 60 gig of hollywood movies. OK, they're ripped and compressed, so it will not be exactly HD DVD quality, but very close. It's so convenient to watch movies on your phone while riding in public transportation. Just the movies alone will cost anyone looking to buy such thing hefty money. And I'm including it for free with the phone. I paid 750 for it early this year. And I'm only asking 500 for it. Cons: I dropped it a few times on concrete while waiting for the bus. Ok, I dropped it more than a few times, but that's not the point is it? I'm just being honest so you know I'm a honest person not trying to rip you off.

What do you do?,"Hey Jim...So, a little update for you. I know you did me a huge favor in lending me the car yesterday, and I really appreciate that. I would LOVE to be able to just go over and hand the keys back to you and say ""gracias"". But alas, I have some bad news. What happened is that as I was driving back from the flea market, my friend was in the passenger seat, and she decided to adjust the mirror to look at her sunglasses. The catch is that it was the rearview mirror and it distracted me! I think I ran over a pothole and all of a sudden the engine started making strange noises. Good news, I did manage to get it off the highway safely and back to my house. But unfortunately, I think you're going to need to take it to a mechanic because there is something seriously wrong with it. So sorry to be the bearer of bad news.","Hello Craigslist buyers.  I am selling a Kindle Fire Tablet.  The retail price for one at the moment is $90.  I find I no longer have use for mine, and there are only one or two problems with it, so I am looking to offload it onto someone else!  So, the screen is still perfectly clear, I also just got done swabbing it down with alcohol and screen cleaner to make it look new and pristine.  One of the issues is, the button to turn it on sometimes sticks, sometimes you have to give it a nice whack against the floor to get it to turn on.  The other issue is that the memory card is broken.  Those two things are not major, and easily reparable, I have upgraded to a different tablet, and I don't think it's worth my time or money to repair.  So, I will sell it for $40, $50 off new retail of this thing, all you need to do is buy a microSD card which is just a few bucks and the tablet will be as good as new minus the power button issue.

Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,single_trial,86

What do you do?,"If it is your car, then it is your insurance that pays for the damage. The only way they would be responsible, would be if you ‘rented’ them the car and had a contract that their insurance would be responsible for any damages. Even that may not work, because your friend’s insurance company itself has to agree that they pay damages for cars that are rented. All insurance companies do not provide that guarantee.

I’ve had a simple rule since high school, since I saw my first car, wrapped around a telephone pole, when my nephew ‘borrowed’ it, with my mother’s permission (the only reason I didn’t have him arrested). He took her to the store, which was the intent, but went joyriding in it after dropping it off home.

My rule is ‘no one borrows any vehicle of mine, period’. Got to go somewhere and I happen to like you, then I will take you there.

Something funny. When I first moved to my current city, I owned two cars (an old one and a new one). A very attractive neighbor offered me a night of sex, if I’d let her borrow my old car the next morning. I thought about it long and hard (no pun intended). Then asked this simple question of her. “Would you make the same offer to loan you $8,000?”

She responded, “No, absolutely not, I wouldn’t ask to borrow that kind of money”! My response was then, “No, you can’t borrow my car, because that is essentially what my car is worth to me”!

Needless to say she didn’t talk to me anymore and the my friends thought I was an idiot! But I still had my car, yeah!

Again, take your friend where they need to go, if they are that important. But remember, lending someone your car is like lending them a huge amount of cash.",dear Mr smith. as you are aware i was late this morning for the important meeting with  the top-level executives in the company this morning.

I have to push back our meeting. I know this is very short notice and the timing is horrible, but I have had a late shipment come into the loading dock. As you know, as warehouse supervisor, standard protocol requires me to stay and do inventory on the stock before I can put it into our supply system. This is to prevent theft, being shortchanged by our manufacturer, and other troublesome events. The late shipment is due to the holiday season and the mail and shipment companies being overloaded.

I’m prepared to walk away if the deal isn’t a good one of course. But if I do have to do that, I want to leave them with a feeling of regret that they won’t be working with someone they instinctively liked as much as me. That strategy very often results in them calling me back for another try.

I will tell you how.
Before 19th Nov 2011, I was happy being an entrepreneur, with goals and plans for growth of my concept based retail-outlet. I was 26 then.  I am a first generation entrepreneur.
My store was listed as country's one of the top 100 stores. I worked extremely hard, and was totally devoid of life, because I believed that 'there will always time to live life later. This is the time to work hard.'

Till 19th Nov 2011, when in a friend's wedding ceremony, my dress caught fire from an earthen lamp. My friend (the groom) who was one of the first ones to notice, immediately jumped to douse it, and I ran away from him, because I was worried that he too would catch fire. I made a mistake in doing so, because the fire caught on like insane, giving me 2nd degree burns on my back.

The only thought that I had in my head for those 45 seconds (fire catches in seconds) was, 'I haven't lived the life I wanted to! I have so much to travel, see and do. And I have done  none of it! I can't be dying yet. There is nothing spectacular that I could recall from my life, at that moment.'

Don't get me wrong;I have had many achievements all through my life. I am from country's one of the best colleges that it has to offer from the fashion domain. My college looks back at me with great pride, and so do my parents and people I have worked with. But at that moment, none of it amounted to anything in the bit that flashed before my eyes. All that was going through my head was ""but I haven't spent enough time with my parents/I wish I had thanked my 8th grade teacher for making me who I am when I had the time to and not procrastinated that phone call to yet another year / I wish I had been around for my people a bit more. In fact, much more!""
Honestly, had destiny willed it to happen that way, there was nothing I could have done, except for dying a death with regrets.

After 3 months of being on bed (and extremely dependent), the first thing I did after I resumed work was to initiate the process of closing down the store. I realized that I had grown roots instead of wings. I stood still when I was meant to soar high. There was no 'later' that was going to happen, ever.

3 years after my decision, I am happy that I took out time to live a bit of life the way I wanted to. There is still much to do and make a difference, but I am glad that I have at least started the process. I write a travel-blog called A Borrowed Backpack, and lead a life that I wanted to.","Hey man.

Web Designing is in huge demand. You can make good money out of it.

Register yourself in online marketplaces like Fiverr, People Per Hour and Elance. They have huge demand. You will start getting order immediately it you portray yourself well.

You can probably make and sell blogs for a nice profit. It is kinda like online real estate. But you have stay determined and learn the trade.

Start taking classes. Try using free advertising portals (for your country) to find local people interested in Web Designing. I'm pretty sure many would like to join.

Web Development is in demand too. If you know how to use frameworks like Wordpress, Drupal, Ruby on Rails or any other framework which is widely used. I would recommend Wordpress as it is the most widely used framework. Start offering Wordpress related services.

Most importantly; use only free resources to market your class or Fiverr account or when you start sellingblogs.",Id just go to a pawn shop and see what i can get for it.

Unlike others - I will not assume that your parents purchased your phone.

I worked as a teen and bought most of the things i wanted (not needed)

Even if they bought it - my advice still maintains.

It wont be what you want to hear either.

Let them.

I know that as a teen you want your privacy. I know that you feel its an entire invasion to your life. That you are beginning to figure out - what you like, don’t like and still trying to understand it all.

But I can almost guarantee - it is for your safety.

I mean - the alternative is the family limiting your time, logging all network access, specifying what apps you can or cannot use, or even taking the phone away altogether.

I recommend having a discussion with your parents.

See if they are willing to explain the importance of this.

the expectation of use.

You can also define what your concerns are.

Remember - that they are still your parents. They have the right to deny without reason. Will you like it .. no.

Your parents MAY be impressed with your attempt to communicate and create an open dialog.

Worst they can say is no eh?

Id like to share an experience when i was a teen.

I was always a nerd - I started building pcs when i was 12.

My mum during the summers had me do homework equivalent to the amount of time wanted to spend on computers.

I hated her for it.. (now i do not, the additional knowledge has helped)

So i had worked hard for two weeks doing homework and was planning on spending the next two weeks just playing on the pc mucking about with it.

I messed up and ended up getting grounded the DAY before my new two week period started.

Can you guess what i was grounded from?

yea.. it was the computer.

I was pissed - i mean - absolutely livid. ( was about 12/13 here)

I decided to lock my mum out of the family pc.

Back in the days of windows xp - you could use multiple methods to get access to an admin account. Hidden or not.

I waited till she left for work on a weekend and picked the lock into her room (not really picking - i found by accident if you rotated the nob at a certain speed and rotate l/r in a certain way - it would unlock on its own - without any real force (no damage))

sat at the desk and went to work.

I changed her password -

I still remember what i changed it to.. Ihatemom (yea- real original but i figured she wouldn’t guess it)

She didn’t - She never got it to work - She was grounded from it while i was. When i got back on it - all of a sudden it started working again.

I NEVER told her till i was an adult - she never figured it out..

Why do i tell this story?

To show you that even as a kid - i rebelled

As an adult - I began to realize why those limitations were in place.

And why I was so willing to go in detail to my answer.","This tablet is being sold AS-IS for PARTS or REPAIR. The screen is shattered but it's still functional. All of the apps and features can still be accessed. I'm the only owner and I bought it new only a year ago. It's not on a contract and is pretty simple to use. The charging port works and I will include a clean case and original charger. BUT it will take about $300 to fully fix the screen. (That's the quote given by Local Repair Shop.) My loss is your gain! The tablet itself can be yours for only $50. So if you pay for the repair, that's $350 total - when the tablet NEW runs for $1200, that's a pretty good deal. No refunds, no returns, you are buying as-is. I will bring the device charged so that you can try it before you buy.","Dear colleagues, In regards to the meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow at noon, I'm afraid we'll have to postpone it until early next week. The blueprints from the architects that were supposed to be ready by tomorrow are delayed. Without that crucial piece of information, we don't have a meeting. Plainly put: we can't discuss the renovation of our office without the blueprints detailing the renovation. In the meantime, take this as an opportunity to get some additional work done for the meeting. I'd like you to come up with 5 to 10 comments or suggestions for your own departments and detail an explanation for why you've come up with such. If you have any questions on this, let me know. Otherwise, I'll get back with you on an updated meeting time.Best, Supervisor","Hey Chris, Sorry to bother you but something big has happened - something you'll probably hate me for. You know that really nice Ford Flex you have? Well, I've always been jealous of it and I asked your girlfriend if I could borrow it to do some rummage sale shopping on Saturday. I had some great finds - including a small dining room table, which I packed safely in the back of the Flex. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see well out of the back window with the furniture piled high...and I backed it right into a concrete pole in the middle of the parking lot. The Flex...is ruined, so ruined. I'm going to give you my insurance info but I know I'm going to be severely paying for it. I don't know if you'll ever trust me again, but I sure hope you'll let me make things right. I'm so sorry. Friend",single_trial,87

I am so so so so sorry but I will have to push back our big scheduled meeting later this week. I know it is super super important but I've unfortunately had an accident!

I crashed my car on the way to my friends party and I had to go to hospital.
It was really totally scary and crazy but I'm okay.

I completely blacked out and someone called me an ambulance, I guess someone stopped when they saw what had happened.

I have a few minor injuries - cuts and bruises but on the whole I am okay. I'm mostly just in shock and I'm sure a little bit concussed.

Don't worry we will reschedule ASAP and I will make sure that you will all have enough notice to be able to prepare adequately and hey, it gives you all extra time to do so.

I hope you all are having a good productive day without me.

I'll see you all real soon,

Boss",Hey mom! I know this my worry you but  I just got into an horrible accident! I am such a klutz but I thankfully survived too bad my car was totalled. I was driving on my way to jessica's house to see her son's third birthday party. And I was crossing an intersection when a run away truck zoomed through a red light and hit my car sending it swerving over onto its side into a grassy area. I was absolutely terrified when it happened. but before I knew it I had completely blacked out. but I assume while I was someone had called an ambulance and I had gotten taken to the hospital with quite a few injuries. It was absolutely crazy. but I am here! Thank god for that. Your little girl wouldnt leave this planet so easily,I know I  am late but you honestly would not believe what had happened to me! It was such a shock. so Here is my story. Well first thing first I was dead set on making my way into work when a deer ran infront of my vehicle and I almost hit it! BUt I didnt I came to a stop at the right moment but the deer stayed in front of my car. I beeped at it but it did not move. I then noticed movement behind it . It had a baby behind it. But the baby was on the ground It would not stand up. I then noticed It was bleeding a bit. Being the kind individual I am I looked up numbers for places that help wildlife. I then called in. And requested for someone to come out and help the poor fawn. After a while of waiting Somebody came down and took the fawn away with the mother. You see so thats why I was late.,Hello My relative. I would like to request some money from you if thats ok? I will be needing about eight thousand. I will need it for a car I've been wanting to buy so I will not be reliant on uber. You know how expensive that can be so eight thousand would help a bunch! I'd be greatful from the very bottom of my heart If i can get it. And I promise to pay you back. Id honestly Need it by sunday and you can transfer it into my bank account. Just message me for my details if you decide to help me out. I am looking forward to seeing you again at christmas time. I know we will have such a fun time with everyone there. If it is more convenient for you can give it to me then though! Thanks for reading my message!,single_trial,88

I am so sorry to have to be writing you this letter instead of talking to you face-to-face.

I unfortunately have some bad news to tell you and that is I have crashed your car you loaned me.
I know it is a very expensive car and I couldn't feel worse than I do right now.
I am personally okay, just a few bumps and bruises but your car is completely totaled.
I was driving down a country lane and unfortunately a deer ran right out in front of me and I swerved to avoid it and ended up hitting the embankment on the side of the road.
If it makes you feel at all better, the deer survived.
I will obviously make this up to you as best as I can and hopefully my insurance will sort the rest.

Once again, I am so sorry and I hope you can forgive me,

Everything was running smoothly and then when I went to get the boys to put them in the car Oliver told me he had swallowed a penny. I called the Dr real quick and they said that can actually be really dangerous on rare occasions, they gave me some symptoms and I went along my day. By time we got Logan to school, Oliver was just about none stop screaming in the back seat. I ended taking him to the ER and found out the penny was dissolving in his stomach and causing a reaction. I have been here with him while they get it out and treat him. He will be fine but has to stay for a while.

If he doesn't give me the money right away, maybe I can ask to volunteer at the wine mixer for his company as a way to show him I am serious and that I will pay him back ASAP. If that doesn't work then I can volunteer to babysit my nephew for a few weeks as well. Whatever it takes, as long as my rent is paid I will be happy. I hope it isn't too much but I don't think it will be for him to help me out.",Id just go to a pawn shop and see what i can get for it. If not much then id make a craig list add for it and make an honest  description and see  what i am able to get from it with that. If not much then Id lie a bit and spruce up the description and sell it for a bit more money through that. Anything to get it sold and get the money I need.  I would then mail it off to them wherever they would live and Hopefully they wont notice how broken it is for a while then I could block their number/email whatevger they used to contact me through and stuff. I would then do whatever I needed to do with the money. After it is sold Id be happy to have gotten rid of it completely and be happy my plan had worked even if its evil.,Hey everyone I know this may come as a surprise but I have to postpone a meeting for another time.

Once again I hope you don't mind and see you all tomorrow where we all be able to eat together. Have a great day you all.,I'd just tell her straight up I need the password to it. Me and my mom are close. Im sure she will give it to me if i explain my reasoning for it. At least Id hope she would. Shes pretty nice and I let her into my accounts sometimes if she really wanted me to. She is my mom so she already knows literally everything about me. And shes not a very private person.  so I dont see why she would say no. She trusts me. She raised me right so she knows I wouldnt do anything devious or mischevious.  I believe with that AI can easily get acess to her accounts . but I guess it would depened on the specific acccount it is. However I do believe no account would be really too much at least I hope it wont be to be honest.,single_trial,89

Sorry for the late notice, but I'm going to have to postpone the meeting we have scheduled for a later time.

I actually wanted to talk to you because I am finally thinking of starting a beer brewing business and was wondering if you'd be interested in investing. I know, after all these years, I finally want to turn my hobby into a profession! I am thinking of going to the bank to get a loan, but wanted to see if you would be interested in helping me get started first before I do that. I have a couple other co founders who are all ready to go, so we're planning to get the process going in a few weeks, so I would need to know fairly soon. If you're interested, let me know, and any form of payment would be greatly appreciated (if you wanted to write a check, or just directly pay for some of the materials we'd need to get started). You would obviously be a partial owner as well, and we can figure those details out when we get started. Hope to hear from you soon!","I have a used Samsung Galaxy Tab for sale, selling it for $400. It comes with the keyboard attachment and a stylus, as well as a few other accessories, such as a case, the charger, and a screen protector. I got it earlier this year, $650 for everything, and was planning to use it for school, but it didn't really work all that well for my purposes. I am dropping the price down to $400 since, even though the screen and most of it is in like new condition, there is a problem with the charger port that would require a repair to fix. It would cost about $100 to fix and can be done at any electronic repair shop, which with the $400 cost would still be cheaper than getting everything brand new, and otherwise, everything else is in great condition.

Apparently my neighbor has some kind of rare disease that gives him seizures, and apparently he was on some kind of medication for it. But it seems something he ate different or some other medication caused him to pass out. His daughter, who is 9 years old, came to my door crying uncontrollably. She was shaking all over because she's the only one at home and she had no idea what to do. And she always trusted me since she came over for the pool party last year when my daughter had it. It's a nice family but the mother has left and it's just the dad and the daughter. I rushed to her house and found the dad passed out on the kitchen floor next to a half made PB&J sandwich. I called 911 and the EMTs came and took him to the ER. But I  couldn't just leave the 9 year child at home by herself after all this. So I drove her to the ER behind the ambulance, and waited for the doctor to treat her dad. He's ok now, and they're back home. And I'm rushing to the meeting as we speak. I'll see you all soon. My sincere apologies.","Almost brand new smartphone for sale. Pros: It's the top of the line released this year. It's got the latest CPU, GPU, and huge storage and room for more with the sd card. It has a tons of movies loaded on to the sd car already. That's about 60 gig of hollywood movies. OK, they're ripped and compressed, so it will not be exactly HD DVD quality, but very close. It's so convenient to watch movies on your phone while riding in public transportation. Just the movies alone will cost anyone looking to buy such thing hefty money. And I'm including it for free with the phone. I paid 750 for it early this year. And I'm only asking 500 for it. Cons: I dropped it a few times on concrete while waiting for the bus. Ok, I dropped it more than a few times, but that's not the point is it? I'm just being honest so you know I'm a honest person not trying to rip you off. So the frame has more than afew dings on it, but they've all been smoothed out so it's not uncomfortable to hold. And the screen is busted.

I mentioned in the ad that the phone is not in the best condition. Let me tell you more about it. I got it as a gift from my ex-boyfriend. But then I found out that he was a stinking cheating liar! But you probably don't care about all of that. The phone itself was a really good one, but when I found out that my boyfriend had been stepping out behind my back I threw it at his car and he drove over it.

Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident.

I will call you later when I'm ready to talk.

Well, they went out of business so now I'm out of the job, and I haven't been able to find a new one yet. I would be so disappointed in myself if I had to quit college, especially because you know my dream is to be a vet tech. I can't continue paying my rent here if I don't come up with some money soon.

Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical keyboards.

To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard, most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by Bluetooth or USB; 2-in-1 PCs have keyboards, distinct from tablets.

Explain to your mother what/when/where/how/why you got into that accident. ,"Being aware of the common risk factors associated with car accidents is important. Many people are in collisions because they are unaware that what they are doing behind the wheel is as dangerous as it is. Speeding, drunk driving, distracted driving, road conditions, and weather are all contributing factors to many crashes.

When a driver speeds, they automatically have less control over their vehicle. In the event they need to stop quickly or take a sharp turn, they could hit the vehicles around them. When someone consumes alcohol and gets behind the wheel their ability to make good decisions and comprehend their surroundings decreases. Distracted driving is also a problem.  Almost everyone travels with a phone and navigational system. Technology, while useful, takes drivers’ eyes, minds, and hands away from the car.",Good morning gentleman.

For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.",Hi Jack it's me I was just wanted to see what you were up to lately I haven't seen you since the big reunions how are Mary and the kids? I've been doing well in school but lately I've had a really difficult time with tuition I'd like to take you up on your offer for a personal loan to help pay for some of my school supplies. You gave me some great advice at the reunions and I wanted to tell you how grateful I am I took you up on your advice and I did get a small part time job that would allow me to earn a little bit of money while I'm in school. So I have a proposal for you if you're willing to make the loan to help me out with school supplies in my tuition I'll be able to start making payments while I'm still in school that we can increase after I've graduated.,single_trial,93

Formulate a story/message that is asking that relative what you need the money for, when you need it, why you need it, and how they should give it to you. ","The wealth of a person consists of both material and non-material goods. Thus the wealth of the person includes such material things as land, houses, furniture, machinery and so on. Not only that, if a person has some shares in companies or bonds which require others to pay money to him, they should be included in his personal wealth. On the other hand, if he owes some debt to others, it should be regarded as negative wealth and so subtracted from his gross wealth. Then we get the net wealth of a person.

Suppose a person is running a firm. The goodwill of his firm may be considered as his immaterial wealth. We have to remember one thing, namely that wealth is external. The personal or internal qualities of a person should not be considered as wealth. For example, a play-back singer may have an excellent voice. It is a personal quality and internal to the person. The voice of the singer is not wealth because it is internal. It is not wealth but it may be the source of wealth to the singer. Another example of internal quality is the ability of a surgeon.","Hi mom,I hope you are having a great week so far!

118,16.539,0,You are a supervisor and you have to push back an important meeting with your supervisees. What happened and how do you tell them?,"The supervisor-employee relationship is the fundamental organizational unit within the County structure. All teams, divisions and departments are built on those relationships. One-on-one meetings are a forum for communication from supervisor to employee, as well as from employee to supervisor. When employees are informed the feeling of involvement increases, along with the sense of ownership that results in job satisfaction and productivity. The employee's role is to take responsibility for what they need from you as their supervisor. Your responsibility is to provide support and add value that helps the employee perform well.
It is recommended that one-on-one meetings be scheduled every two weeks. This allows for frequent, individualized communication. If a meeting needs to be cancelled due to an overriding commitment by either the supervisor or the employee, no more than about a month should go by between meetings.","Hi mom,Please don't worry about me.

119,16.539,8,You borrowed your friend's favorite expensive car and you crashed it. It is now completely broken. How do you explain what happened? What do you do?,"Well, Archie, the vast majority of the cars I drive are covered by the car owner's insurance policy. The majority of car insurers in the majority of situations cover vehicles when they're being driven by someone else under ""permissive use"" from the owner. In other words: If you, Archie, give me permission to drive your 1994 Honda Civic, and I crash it, then I'm covered under your policy because I'm operating the car with your permissive use.

Most car reviewers stop there, and they never really worry about the consequences of driving someone else's car beyond the fact that they're covered under that someone else's insurance policy. But I'm a rather anxious individual when it comes to this stuff, so that wasn't good enough for me.","Dear colleagues, In regards to the meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow at noon, I'm afraid we'll have to postpone it until early next week.

While I was there, though, the electricity cut to the office. It immediately came back on - but it was clear that some of the internet capabilities did not immediately register back on. I had to call the Internet company and see what was going on. That took another 20 minutes. By the time I got that sorted out, got to the car, and drove the 10 minutes to the downtown office, the meeting had already begun.

125,18.59008333333333,4,You are a supervisor and you have to push back an important meeting with your supervisees. What happened and how do you tell them?,"Question your assumptions
Webb suggests you start by considering what you actually know. You may think your coworker went over your head to spite you, but perhaps you’re misreading the situation. Look at only the facts and avoid snap judgments. For example, rather than thinking, “He completely disregarded my authority,” tell yourself, “He had a conversation with my boss about the initiative he’s working on.” Then ask yourself: Are there different ways to explain what happened? “Work out three or four different scenarios that broaden your aperture and help you question the assumption that this person has been dastardly or ill-intended,” suggests Webb. It might just be a simple misunderstanding, notes Galinsky, who admits that he once went around a department chair to speak to his then-dean, not realizing it would be frowned upon. “It never occurred to me that the dean would then go to the chair,” he confesses.

Find out more
If you don’t know all the facts of the situation – perhaps you just heard about the conversation through the office rumor mill – try to find out what really happened, says Webb. You might go to your boss and ask in a neutral way about what transpired: “Hey, I heard you and Carlos were talking about his new idea.” Take care to maintain a casual, non-accusatory tone so that your boss doesn’t think you’re trying to start a feud.

Approach your colleague
Ask your coworker if the two of you can talk — preferably in a private room. Keep an open mind as you enter the conversation, says Webb. “Don’t go into the conversation with the intention of sticking it to your coworker. Instead think about the importance of your working relationship.” Focus on your ultimate goal, whether it’s to restore trust or to protect your authority. And be ready to hear what he has to say about the situation and why he did what he did.

State your position
Begin by saying what you know in a “straightforward” way, says Galinsky. Explain why you’re disappointed, but stay away from words like “angry” or “betrayed,” Webb adds.

What do you do?,"If you drive your car and cause an accident, your car insurance will pay for the damages you cause, as defined in your policy. If your friend drives and crashes your car, you may assume that he -- and his car insurance -- will pay for damages. In fact, you are on the hook.

Lending your car to a friend can be an expensive favor if he or she gets into a car accident while cruising your ride. Despite the fact that you may think the accident and resulting costs will fall to your friend's insurance policy, it will actually be your insurance coverage that will be paying the bills for your buddy’s driving mishap, assuming you gave the person permission to drive your vehicle.

Car insurance tends to follow the car in most circumstances so if someone else is driving your car and is involved in an accident, your insurance will be considered primary, meaning that all claims will go through it, up to your coverage limits.","Hey Uncle Herman.

127,18.59008333333333,6,You are extremely late for an important meeting with top-level executives in the company that you work for. Create a story for why you were late that will convince them not to fire you. ,"1. Identify the behavior.
It’s understandable if an employee has a legitimate reason for being late every once in a while. Traffic accidents happen, weather intervenes, kids get sick. Life happens and unexpected problems do come up occasionally. What’s not acceptable is an employee who shows up late most of the time.

When a staff member consistently shows up late, he's essentially not respecting your time, or his own. That’s when you need to decide if your employee's behavior is worth condoning or reprimanding

2. Be proactive.
Don’t let a person’s excessive tardiness go so long that you react in anger. Remember, you’re tired of the behavior, not the person. Try not to lose your cool. It’s counterproductive to use foul language or threaten an employee.

Deal with the situation as soon as you see a pattern arise; then be proactive. Schedule a time to talk and address the issue one-on-one. Bring documentation of an employee's tardiness into your meeting and ask him what is preventing him for reporting to work on time.
3. Verbalize your disappointment.
It’s a trick your mother probably used on you as a child. Most people tend to be disappointed in themselves when someone they respect is disappointed in them. When a team member doesn’t follow through on a commitment, explain the consequences of his actions. If he is late to a client meeting, say something like, “The client waited ten minutes for you to arrive. I had to ask Ashley to fill in for you.” Perhaps the employee doesn’t realize (although he should) that his behavior affects his co-workers, as well.","Hey Mom, you know how you always ask me what are some hot buys on Amazon?

For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer.

","Of all of the common assumptions that we discussed in class, I think one of the most common is the idea that a children’s text should in some way teach the reader something.  We of course talked about the term didactic, and how a didactic book strongly pushes a lesson onto the reader, telling them that they should believe this or that.  Many times a reason for that lesson isn’t even given, as though the young person reading the book should just accept that lesson because they are told to, because the other knows better.  As I was reading Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss, the book I selected for the assignment, I was hoping that it wouldn’t be as didactic as most other children’s books, and that it would be as playful and exciting as I remember as a child.  On the last two pages of the book, however, the absent mother returns home, the cat has disappeared, the children are behaving nicely, sitting in chairs, and it is pretty obvious that even though they got into mischief they are still good children after all.  Nothing really has changed at the end of the book.  Although all sorts of things got played with, and the children broke the rules I am sure they know about (like, “Don’t fly kites in the house”), major boundaries were never crossed. 

            We talked about how the opposite of a didactic book might be an ambiguous book, or a book that encourages the reader to think about issues, to make decisions for themselves.  In that kind of book, the author usually wants to the reader to think for her or himself, to understand that some things are difficult, even for adults.  The author may present a problem and ask you what you think, or might just never come around to saying exactly what you are supposed to believe.  The last page of Cat in the Hat ends with the narrator saying, referring to the mother, “Should we tell her about it? / Now what SHOULD we do? / Well . . . / What would YOU do / If your mother asked you?” (61).  In some ways, this is probably a pretty ambiguous ending.  The author asks the reader that if your mother left, if someone wanted you to do what you weren’t supposed to, if you did it anyway, and if you didn’t get caught, then would you tell your mother or father what happened?  Most adults wouldn’t tell what happened themselves, but the question is there anyway, and it seems to be really asking children what they believe.","To whomever it may concern,I'm selling my Samsung Galaxy S10+, which is in ""like new"" condition but with just a couple light scratches on the exterior.

I hope everyone will have a great time. I'm so happy that I get to reward the entire team, and spend some time with the people who helped make this company what it is today. Please RSVP to this email if you can't make it. Cheers!","Mom, it is very important that you listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you. I am currently in an unknown location, being held against my will. My captors have given me only one instruction. I need to transfer money from our joint account into their offshore bank account by midnight tonight or they will kill me. Please Mom, these men are serious. I need to know the password for the account and I will be able to make the wire transfer from my location with their help. If you can just do this one thing, they promised to let me go and never bother our family again. I love you so much, and I'm very sorry this is happening. I do not know these people where they came from, or why they have this motive. I would really appreciate your help, and hopefully we will be together soon safely- and happily.",Good morning gentleman. First I'd like to take the opportunity to sincerely apologize for my late arrival at this morning this morning's meeting. Despite the unforeseen circumstances I do have a fairly interesting story to share and a valuable lesson to tell you about that I learned today. I was just about to enter the I-95 exit ramp when I noticed a car pulled over on the shoulder. I pulled up next to the car and started to roll down my window when I noticed a woman was reclined in the backseat with the door open I carefully pulled over to see if she needed help. That's when I noticed she was in the midst of giving birth. Even though I have almost no medical training she assured me that she and her husband had been through classes and she could help me until the paramedics arrived. I called 911 unfortunately I didn't have to play paramedics this morning but I did get to witness a beautiful live birth right on the shoulder of I-95.,single_trial,96

Formulate a story/message that is asking that relative what you need the money for, when you need it, why you need it, and how they should give it to you. ","Hi Auntie Reese. I know you hate how impersonal emails can be but I need to ask for a favor and I know that this is probably the quickest way to reach you. My dog is very ill and I can't bare the thought of losing her. You remember Penelope don't you? The veterinarian is saying that she needs two surgeries to remove potentially cancerous tumors. I know how much you love dogs. Can you please gift the money to me auntie? I would be eternally grateful. Penelope is like a child to me. I know you can understand because you have your cats Coco and Twinkie. I would need the money by Tuesday to schedule the surgeries for next week. I am so torn about it and I hate to ask for money, but I love her so much. Please let me know your decision.
Love always, your only niece","To whomever it may concern,Unfortunately, I'm going to have to reschedule that important meeting that we had scheduled for today at 3:30. The meeting will now be this Friday at 3:30, instead of today, so you all can go home early instead of staying after work for the meeting today. I know this meeting was important but my son got expelled from school today for missing too many classes, and I need to speak with the Principal of his school and my wife, and figure out what to do next. Right now, I need to be with my family and as I always tell you all, family should always come first. Now, I told you all what happened because I didn't want you to worry about why the meeting was re-scheduled because I know that isn't something I would normally do. Take care, and I'll see you all at work on Friday!","Dear Jessica,I'm so sorry that I'm sending you an e-mail instead of a proper phone call, but honestly I don't know how I can speak the words out loud. This morning on the way to work, I was on an icy road and although I was slowed down, there was another car who was driving too fast and crashed right into the back of your car. I think the car might totaled, which breaks my heart, because you trusted me to take excellent care of your car. I completely betrayed your trust by crashing your expensive car. Don't worry, Jessica, I'll help you call the insurance company and see what we can do about a possible repair or replacement. Unfortunately, I don't have much money to my name so I can't pay you for the car, but we will get this figured out! I promise! I'm so sorry, and I love you so much, and I hope you can forgive me.Love Your Friend,Ashleigh","Hi mom,Please don't worry about me. I know you haven't heard from me since yesterday and I'm going to explain to you why. Please just don't freak out about this! I'm writing you an e-mail because my voice is too shaky from the pain and stress I've been through today. Earlier today, on the way to work this morning, while on the freeway I slid into the median, where my car got out of control, and crashed into a tree. The roads were very slippery from the snow and hadn't been salted yet since it was so early in the morning, around 4am. Before you worry, I am okay and as far as we know, I don't have any brain damage, but I did have a broken leg from the accident. The doctors have said that I'm likely to make a full recovery, which is great news, because I almost died from the crash and they said I should be very thankful that more damage hasn't been done. I will call you later when I'm ready to talk. Love you, mom!",single_trial,96

I'm just letting you know in advance we are going to have to move the meeting. I was going down the stairs to where my car is and tripped and fell down the concrete stairs and sprained my ankle. I hate to do this to you all but I am in the doctor's office and won't get out in time to make it across town. I think if we reschedule for tomorrow that will be the best. They're putting a cast on my ankle and I won't even be able to drive myself home and have to take an uber and then take another one back to get my car, but maybe that won't work either. I don't know exactly. Anyway that's where we are with this and I hope you understand. Tomorrow is better anyway for other reasons now that I think about it so I hope we can all get it sorted and make it tomorrow. If not let me know and I will see if I can work something else out!",Hey mom! I know this my worry you but  I just got into an horrible accident! I am such a klutz but I thankfully survived too bad my car was totalled. I was driving on my way to jessica's house to see her son's third birthday party. And I was crossing an intersection when a run away truck zoomed through a red light and hit my car sending it swerving over onto its side into a grassy area. I was absolutely terrified when it happened. but before I knew it I had completely blacked out. but I assume while I was someone had called an ambulance and I had gotten taken to the hospital with quite a few injuries. It was absolutely crazy. but I am here! Thank god for that. Your little girl wouldnt leave this planet so easily,Hello My relative. I would like to request some money from you if thats ok? I will be needing about eight thousand. I will need it for a car I've been wanting to buy so I will not be reliant on uber. You know how expensive that can be so eight thousand would help a bunch! I'd be greatful from the very bottom of my heart If i can get it. And I promise to pay you back. Id honestly Need it by sunday and you can transfer it into my bank account. Just message me for my details if you decide to help me out. I am looking forward to seeing you again at christmas time. I know we will have such a fun time with everyone there. If it is more convenient for you can give it to me then though! Thanks for reading my message!,I know I  am late but you honestly would not believe what had happened to me! It was such a shock. so Here is my story. Well first thing first I was dead set on making my way into work when a deer ran infront of my vehicle and I almost hit it! BUt I didnt I came to a stop at the right moment but the deer stayed in front of my car. I beeped at it but it did not move. I then noticed movement behind it . It had a baby behind it. But the baby was on the ground It would not stand up. I then noticed It was bleeding a bit. Being the kind individual I am I looked up numbers for places that help wildlife. I then called in. And requested for someone to come out and help the poor fawn. After a while of waiting Somebody came down and took the fawn away with the mother. You see so thats why I was late.,single_trial,97
136,32.95543333333333,5,You borrowed your friend's favorite expensive car and you crashed it. It is now completely broken. How do you explain what happened? What do you do?,Hi Marcia. I have bad news for you unfortunately in regards to your car. I will just tell you what happened. I was driving it in to the car wash to wash it before I returned to you and it hit a spot of black ice. It was invisible and I didn't see it. The car slid off the road and hit a lightpole. I had it towed. Unfortunately it looks to be a complete loss. I know this comes as a shock to you and I am sorry that it happened and will make it up to you and am glad that you are insured. You are insured right? It is at Bob's towing service off the highway near 42nd street exit but they say it's totaled and will need to be replaced with another car. The insurance company will cover this right? That is what I'm hoping.,"To my team,I am going to have to push back our meeting that was scheduled for today. Allen Sr is in town and Jr is throwing a fit. He wasn't supposed to come back till next weekend, but there was terrible weather in Florida for the rest of the week so he came early. He hasn't been to visit yet. Jr asked me to go down to the old building to clear it out and get it ready for his dads visit. Jr and I will be there all night and most of the day tomorrow. We can try to communicate through emails some of the topics we had planned to discuss. Please keep working on the temple job, and when you are not busy on that make sure the warehouse is being inventoried. We will go over everything else when I get back, and discuss the new warehouse setup once we a detailed list of what there actually is back there.","Mom,I am sorry to worry you, I know you haven't been able to get in contact with me. I am in the hospital now recovering from a terrible car accident. It was bad, but please don't worry too much. I am recovering fine, and you can come visit soon if you want. I was leaving The shop at Herman's the other day. I went down the road by the pond that guy built himself. Someone pulled out from that stupid stop sign too far to check for cars. I had to swerve at the last minute to not run into him, but it was a little slippery and my car started to spin. A car coming the opposite direction ran into me and pinned my car between his and a tree. Of course it was the driver side right where I was sitting the tree hit. I had one surgery already, I got some metal in me now. The dr say I should make a good recovery.Love alwaysT","I have a tablet for sale. It is not the best tablet obviously looking at the picture. I do have a lot of accessories that go with it. I have a case for it, and some extra screen protectors, even a decent pair of earbuds I can throw in. It has been a great phone to me. I can't promise too much with it. The honest truth is that it will need some work to whoever buys it. I could really use any money I could get for it. It was my sons tablet for playing games on. I was thinking if anyone was interested, I could throw in his google play account with all his games on it. He doesn't play most of them anymore, at least not on that account. He has quite a bit of progress on Mine craft and Roblox both. His prized possession on there was his call of duty account. I don't know a lot about it you would have to talk to him. If there are any gamers out there, I know he put a lot of work into all these games, maybe they are worth something to you too.",single_trial,97

Create a story for why you were late that will convince them not to fire you. ,"I need to tell you that I am not going to be able to make it to the meeting in time. This comes as a shock but I assure you it was through no fault of my own. I was on my way to the meeting, early for it I might add, when I was attacked by several wild dogs. I was able to get away by climbing on a dumpster and up onto the bottom of a billboard sign but then I was stuck there for two and a half hours until the people who owned the sign came to tell me to get down and chased off the dogs. I realize this sounds farfetched but it happened to me once before and that time I had to go to the hospital. I can get the two people who chased off the dogs to sign a statement that this actually happened if you think it is necessary.","Hello there co-workers and friends!  I'm sorry this is short notice, I know we had a meeting today in the green room at 6:00 PM.  I unfortunately had some personal things come up and need to cancel.  Your time is very valuable to me, and I only do this because there is absolutely no other option I have here.  I'm going to look to reschedule it until 7:30 PM.  That should give me enough time to wrap up what just came up and get back here to talk to you about the harassment claims going on in this company.  I am taking this issue incredibly serious, and I am setting aside as much time as possible to deal with it when I return, you will have my ear until you feel your concerns have been heard.  We take this very seriously, and we will do everything we can to address it, I just hope you aren't too upset I need to push it back.","Hey Aunt Esme.  I'm sorry to do this via email, but I haven't been able to reach your phone, and I know your business email gets checked hourly.  I hate to ask ANYONE for money, but especially you after everything you've done for our family.  But, Dad fell down and hurt himself pretty bad at work, the insurance won't cover the surgery needed to fix his back.  It's an emergency situation, and they said that they need to do it immediately to prevent permanent damage to him. I have already raised a good portion of the money from my own bank account, and friends, but we're still short $3,000.  The doctor will not start the surgery without it.  If at all possible, you have my venmo, please Aunt Esme!  I'll do everything in my power to pay it back to you as soon as possible, but this is about my dad's future.  I need your help.Love,Your Nephew.","Hey Mom, you know how you always ask me what are some hot buys on Amazon?  Well, I was going to add a bunch of stuff to your cart so you could see, but unfortunately, I don't have your login info.  I know you hate getting links in the email, so I think this is probably the best way for me to do it.  If you give me your login, Ill fix up your account, put your new address in there, and take care of the account I set up for you to get it all running smoothly.  It shouldn't take long, and if you really want, can change the password right after I finish.  Can you let me know what it is so I can get your wishlist set up, as well as your address and phone number and such?  It's very important to have everything going so the Christmas shopping you're about to do doesn't get too impacted.",single_trial,97

I hope someone will buy it and am advertising it online and on flyers with a picture and a description of the various pieces and how they add up to a whole phone if someone will put the work in putting it back together. I aim my ads at people ""who are good at technology and fixing broken things"". I would say in the ad, ""if you are good at putting phones together that have fallen apart into a dozen small but individually intact pieces then this is the phone for you."" I would end the ad with ""please buy my phone I need the money."" Then I would put close up pictures of each of the pieces along with a description of what I think the pieces are for.","Hi Terry, it's me. Unfortunately, I'm writing to you today because I have bad news. I'm extremely embarrassed to admit that I've been very Reckless with my behavior lately. I'll just get right to the point. Last night I borrowed your Tesla. That's right, your baby, your favorite, the great love of your life. I'm very embarrassed to admit that I went out and had a lot to drink last night. For whatever irresponsible reason, when I returned home I saw your shiny red baby parked in the driveway. I had a spare key so without thinking, I ran straight over, hopped in the seat and started barreling down our street. Well, my little Adventure came to an abrupt end as I hit the gate to the complex. So it is with great sympathy that I need to let you know that your Tesla is no longer. Since the car was wrapped completely around the fence and gate, my insurance adjuster informed me that it was totaled. I'm extremely extremely sorry, and I promise to repay every penny. I left the keys to my car on your front porch. Please feel free to drive it until I'm able to replace your baby.","Hi team, I've recently checked our data from this quarter and it looks like everything's on target just like we planned.

I know it has been several years since we talked last and I thought I would check in on you and see how you are doing. How is Uncle Bill? Anyway, I'm doing well. Oh just one little thing. I borrowed some money from some guys and I needed it to pay for the plumber to come fix the plumbing at the house. You know how old houses are? They always break. Haha. Anyway I guess the guys wanted me to pay them back sooner than I thought they would and I can't come up with the money in time. They're kind of mad I think.

I inquired about it and it turns out that all I need is to give them my proof of income, which is in that savings account you made for me.
